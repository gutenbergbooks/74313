<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE MERRY FIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Merry Five were Molly, Kirke, and
Weezy Rowe, and their twin comrades, Paul
and Pauline Bradstreet, who lived over the
way. Paul, Pauline, and Molly were now
fourteen years old, Kirke was twelve, and
little Miss Weezy seven. The story begins
with the Rowes at luncheon-time.</p>

<p>“O papa! I’m so glad we’re going to the
beach,” cried Molly, laying down her fork.</p>

<p>“And I’m glad we’re going to be so near
Captain Bradstreet’s camp,” added Kirke,
flourishing his napkin. “Oh! we shall have
a famous outing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“<i>Exquit!</i>” chirped Weezy, not at all sure
what an outing might be, only that it must
be something jolly.</p>

<p>“Me too, mamma,” lisped Baby Donald,
paddling with his spoon in his bowl of milk.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowe had caused this unusual excitement
by reading aloud a letter from Mrs.
Kitto, who kept a boarding-house at Santa
Luzia. The letter stated that she had received
Mr. Rowe’s note of inquiry, and that if he
desired it, she would take himself and family
as boarders on the following Wednesday.</p>

<p>“You do desire it, papa; don’t you?” added
Molly eagerly.</p>

<p>“If your mamma does, my daughter.”</p>

<p>“It will be difficult to leave so soon,”
remarked Mrs. Rowe, thoughtfully stroking
Donald’s restless fingers.</p>

<p>“But we children can help,” said Molly
quickly. “We have helped a great deal
since vacation; now, haven’t we, mamma?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Certainly you have, my dear,” returned
Mrs. Rowe with a smile. Did Molly remember
that this vacation was as yet hardly two
days old?</p>

<p>The first thing that Molly did after luncheon
by way of helping, was to run across the street
to Captain Bradstreet’s to signal to Pauline in
the cheery trill that all school-girls know.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Kitto can take us, Polly! We’re
going Wednesday!” she cried, as Pauline came
dancing out, her long hair floating behind her
like a black flag.</p>

<p>“You are, Molly? Papa says <i>we</i> sha’n’t be
off before the first of next month. But he
has partly promised to let Paul and me stop
at Santa Luzia on the way.”</p>

<p>“O Pauline, how perfectly lovely!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t believe he’d ever think of such
a thing,” said Pauline, braiding her hair.
“He’s so silly about us twins since mamma
died. Can’t bear to have us out of his sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“I don’t wonder, Polly, I’m sure.” Molly’s
eyes glowed with pity, as they always did
when Pauline spoke of her dead mother. She
longed to tell Pauline how sorry she was for
her, but the words would not come. What
she did say was only this, “Your shoe-string’s
untied, Polly, the right one.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Well, it might as well be the
right as the left. It’s sure to be one or the
other,” returned easy-going Pauline, stooping
to fasten the offending lacing.</p>

<p>“Oh! won’t it be delightful if you and Paul
can come to Santa Luzia, Polly? I hope you
can stay at Mrs. Kitto’s a whole week.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Molly dear, and I”—Pauline
had been about to say that she hoped Molly
and Kirke would stay at least that length of
time at the camp; but suddenly remembered
that there might not be room enough for
them. She must ask her father.</p>

<p>“I—I suppose Auntie David will meet us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
at Santa Luzia,” she said, to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“What does make you call her Auntie
David, Pauline? You’ve never told me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul and I began to call her that
when we were little snips, and we’ve done
it ever since. Auntie doesn’t mind. Her
name is Davidson, you know. She married
Uncle John Davidson.”</p>

<p>“Will Mr. Davidson come to Santa Luzia
too, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; Uncle John has gone East. He
goes East every summer on business, and
then Auntie comes to live with us. Lucky
for Paul and me; lucky for papa too! Auntie
David is papa’s only sister. I believe he
thinks she made the world!”</p>

<p>“Well, I must skip back,” said Molly, with
an important air. “Kirke has gone over to
Mrs. Carillo’s to see if Manuel wants to keep
Kirke’s cart and burro while we’re away;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and mamma may want me to do some errands.”</p>

<p>All the rest of the week there was a pleasant
bustle in the Rowe household, the bustle of
preparing for a journey.</p>

<p>“We’re going to ride in the cars,” little
Miss Weezy explained to all callers. “We’re
going to Sandy Luzia. It’s ’most a hundred
miles.”</p>

<p>The little maiden was very busy these days;
for she had to hunt up her scattered dolls,
many of them having strayed out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowe, though still far from strong,
was very busy too.</p>

<p>“I must drive over to the gardener’s this
morning to instruct him in regard to the hedge,”
he said to Mrs. Rowe the next Monday.</p>

<p>“Shall we shut up Zip?” asked Mrs. Rowe,
as she brought her husband a glass of milk.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” Mr. Rowe smiled. “Let
the little Mexican follow. I believe his dogship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
thinks none of the family can be trusted
anywhere without him.”</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Rowe had gone, Mrs. Rowe
hastened to call Molly from the book she was
reading.</p>

<p>“Come, Molly, while papa is away we will
begin our packing. Please ask Hop Kee to
take the largest trunk from the store-room,
and set it down in the upper hall in front
of the grate.”</p>

<p>Molly put “Alice in Wonderland” upon the
table with a little sigh, and walked out to
the kitchen rather more slowly than a girl
ought to walk when she goes on her mother’s
errands. She was thinking about Alice and
that surprising rabbit. What <i>would</i> he do
next?</p>

<p>“Now, children, you can collect the articles
that you cannot do without,” said Mrs. Rowe,
after the trunk had been placed before the
unused grate. “The necessary articles must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
be put in first, for we sha’n’t have room for
everything you’d like.”</p>

<p>Kirke immediately brought his tennis-racket,
his foot-ball, and his jointed fishing-rod, and
flung them into the trunk.</p>

<p>“I must have my tool-box, too, mamma,
and the ship I’m rigging, and”—</p>

<p>“Any clothes, Kirke?” interrupted Molly
mischievously, as she appeared with an armful
of bathing-suits.</p>

<p>Kirke had not thought of clothes; and when
these had been hunted up, and laid smoothly
over the bathing-suits, he grudged them the
space they occupied.</p>

<p>But his mamma did not let him remain idle.</p>

<p>“You may get the hammock next, Kirke,
and papa’s afghan and pillows.”</p>

<p>Kirke skipped down-stairs two steps at a
time, and speedily returned with the hammock
slung over his shoulder, and bulging in a very
peculiar manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Here’s a big hang-bird’s nest, mamma.
It has one wee bird in it. Do you want to
see the fellow hop?”</p>

<p>“O Kirke! what made you bring Donald
here now?” said Mrs. Rowe, with a vexed
laugh, as Kirke spilled his baby brother at
her feet.</p>

<p>Donald scrambled up, and rested his chin
on the edge of the trunk to see his mamma
put in the sofa-pillows, and spread blankets
over them. “P’itty ’itty bed,” said he.</p>

<p>“So you think that’s a bed do you, little
brother?” cried Kirke, much amused. “It
does look like your cribby, that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“P’itty ’itty <i>mamma</i>,” pursued the young
rogue, throwing his arms about his mother’s
neck, partly because he loved her, partly because
he feared she was going to send him
away.</p>

<p>“There, sweetheart, that will do,” said she
at last, between his kisses. “Mamma is busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
now. Brother must take little Donald down-stairs.”</p>

<p>“Pit-a-bat, pit-a-bat,” pleaded the baby.
He saw he must go, and, as that was the
case, preferred to go in state, riding on his
brother’s back.</p>

<p>“Well, pick-a-back it is, then,” exclaimed
Kirke, slinging the teasing child across his
shoulders. In the lower hall he met Captain
Bradstreet and Pauline.</p>

<p>“You’re the very young man I want to speak
to,” cried the cheery captain; “I want”—</p>

<p>“Now, papa, Kirke’s not so <i>very</i> young,
I’m sure,” interrupted Pauline archly.</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet chuckled as though his
motherless daughter had made a witty remark.</p>

<p>“True, my little girl, Kirke’s not so very
young; but then, on the other hand, not so
old as he may be later.”</p>

<p>“I’m going on thirteen, Captain Bradstreet,”
said Kirke, jealous for his own dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The captain chuckled again, and wiped his
sunburned face so hard that Kirke half looked
for a crimson stain on the white pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, to be sure, you’ll overtake your
father before long, Kirke. Hop Kee says
your father’s not at home.”</p>

<p>“No; papa has gone to Mr. Gleason’s, Captain
Bradstreet.”</p>

<p>“We’ve come, Pauline and I, to engage
you and that big sister of yours to visit us
at our camp when we’re settled in it. Pauline
won’t sleep a wink till this thing’s arranged.
Can we see your mother?”</p>

<p>Kirke set Donald down upon the floor, and
hastened to the upper hall, where Molly was
capering about in the wildest excitement.</p>

<p>“O mamma! did you hear what Captain
Bradstreet said? Did you hear? He wants
Kirke and me to make a visit at his camp—I
never made a visit at a camp in my life!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Yes, mamma,” said Kirke, in the same low
tone, “Captain Bradstreet wants to ask you if
Molly and I can go. Came on purpose.”</p>

<p>“O mamma! you’ll say yes; won’t you?”
begged Molly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe was hastily laying aside her
apron.</p>

<p>“We’ll ask papa, Molly. Captain Bradstreet
is certainly very kind.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t think Captain Bradstreet’s kind—I
don’t think he’s kind a bit,” muttered little
Miss Weezy, as the others went down-stairs.
“Never ’vited me at all! Didn’t I ’vite him
to my seven-years-old party, ice-cream to it
too? O dear, dear, dear!”</p>

<p>Unloading an apronful of dolls in a heap
by the trunk, offended little Weezy stole down
the back staircase into the garden to confide
her sorrows to Ginger, Molly’s yellow kitten.</p>

<p>“Captain Bradstreet said I was a nice, sweet
little girl; he said it two times, he truly did.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
And now he’s gone and asked Kirke and
Molly to go to his—to his something—oh,
yes, he’s asked them, and never asked me.”</p>

<p>Ginger purred softly, and rubbed her head
against her little mistress’s feet; but Weezy
could not be comforted. What a miserable
old world it was to be sure, where captains
called you nice, sweet little girls, and then
went and didn’t invite you to their—to their—she
couldn’t quite remember what.</p>

<p>Grown-up people liked big boys and girls
like Kirke and Molly; they didn’t like little
ones like herself and Donald.</p>

<p>Poor little Donald, he was crying too. She
heard him. What was he crying about?
Weezy wondered. And where was he? He
seemed a great way off, by the sound, ’most
up in the sky. Why didn’t somebody find
him and make him happy?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Weezy</span>, Weezy, is Donald out there in
the garden with you?”</p>

<p>This was Molly calling from the back
porch.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t,” answered Weezy, in a discouraged
tone.</p>

<p>“He’s screaming himself hoarse, Weezy,
and we can’t find him anywhere in the
house.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him.” Weezy walked
slowly toward her sister. “Has Captain
Bradstreet gone, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Weezy, and Pauline.”</p>

<p>“Did Captain Bradstreet say”—</p>

<p>“Maybe Donald followed Pauline and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
father home, Molly,” suggested Mrs. Rowe
from the doorway.</p>

<p>“No, mamma, I’ve been over to ask. I
couldn’t hear Donald on that side of the
street, either. He must be in this house.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’d like to know where, Molly,” exclaimed
Kirke, springing out upon the porch.
“I’ve dived into all the wardrobes and under
all the beds.”</p>

<p>His face was crimson, and his hair on end
like the spines of a sea-urchin. A cobweb
dangled from his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>“Have you looked in the sideboard, Kirke?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t, Molly; and I haven’t looked
in the salt-cellars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny boy!” tittered Weezy, who
regarded the search as a protracted and
rather diverting game of hide-and-go-seek.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe, on the contrary, was becoming
seriously troubled.</p>

<p>“Where can the darling be, Molly?” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
cried, rushing back into the house, and hurrying
from room to room. “I can hardly hear
his voice now. How faint it has grown!”</p>

<p>“It is loudest here in the hall, mamma,”
said Molly, who had run ahead, and halted
abruptly at the foot of the front stairway.</p>

<p>“Donny is up chimney, I guess,” cried
little Louise, dancing to the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Weezy; do you think he is a
bat?” retorted Molly.</p>

<p>Kirke dropped on his knees before the
hearth. He had been stuck in a chimney
once himself, and the recollection always made
his flesh creep.</p>

<p>“If Donald has crawled up this flue, Molly,
it’s no laughing matter, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you talking about, Kirke? Donald
couldn’t crawl up that flue; it is altogether
too small.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure, Molly. Don can squeeze
through a knothole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Donald, Donald darling,” called Mrs.
Rowe shrilly. “Where are you, Donald?
Tell mamma.”</p>

<p>A plaintive, muffled wail floated down the
air.</p>

<p>“Tum, mamma, tum.”</p>

<p>“Donald <i>is</i> in the chimney, mamma! Oh,
I’m so afraid he <i>is</i> in here!” groaned Kirke,
trying to gaze into the chimney’s blackened
throat.</p>

<p>But he only bumped his head against
the andirons and twisted his neck for
nothing.</p>

<p>“There are bricks in the way, mamma,
stacks of them. I can’t see a single thing.”</p>

<p>“Tum, oh, tum!” cried the choked voice
again; and this time they were sure it came
from above them.</p>

<p>But did it actually proceed from the throat
of the chimney? It was Mrs. Rowe who
first thought of the unused grate in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
upper hall. Might not Donald have wedged
his restless little body into that? He was
constantly teasing to go up on the roof.</p>

<p>“Here I am, dearest, mamma is here,” she
called, mounting the staircase, the children
at her heels, and stumbling across the clothing
that strewed the floor.</p>

<p>Before the grate stood the large trunk she
had been packing. She had left it open, and
now it was closed; but she was too agitated
to notice the change.</p>

<p>“Quick, Kirke, this trunk is in the way.
Help me move it out from the grate.”</p>

<p>Kirke laid hold of the handle nearest.</p>

<p>“What a heavy trunk, mamma! What
makes”—</p>

<p>At that moment there was a stifled cry
of “Mamma, mamma!”</p>

<p>Kirke jumped as if he had been shot, for
the words seemed spoken directly in his ear.</p>

<p>“Donald’s in the trunk,” he roared, letting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
go the handle. “The little monkey is in the
trunk!”</p>

<p>“He’s packed himself, Donny’s packed
himself!” shouted Weezy, hopping about on
one foot. “What an ever-so-queer baby!”</p>

<p>Molly flew to the trunk, but it was fastened.</p>

<p>“Oh, this lock! This hateful, hateful
spring-lock. Where <i>is</i> the key?”</p>

<p>“I left it in the lock. I know I left it in
the lock,” exclaimed Mrs. Rowe, groping hastily
about the carpet. “Help me, children,
do help me find it!”</p>

<p>“Tum, mamma. Why don’t oo tum?”</p>

<p>The voice was very low, oh, very, very low,
little more than a sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my baby; mamma will come.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe was yet hunting the key, and
hunting to no purpose.</p>

<p>“Bring a hammer, Kirke,” she cried hurriedly.
“Bring a screw-driver—no, a chisel.
Call Hop Kee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>It seemed centuries before Kirke returned
with the tools; in reality it was only three
minutes. Then Hop Kee came flying in as
though fired from a sling or swung by his
own long pigtail. Behind him appeared Captain
Bradstreet and Pauline to learn if Donald
had been found; and among them all the
trunk was speedily opened.</p>

<p>Little Donald lay upon the pillows gasping
for breath, and clasping in his chubby hand
the missing key.</p>

<p>“Peepaboo, Donny! Peepaboo!” cried
Weezy.</p>

<p>But the released prisoner did not answer.
Mrs. Rowe caught the pale, limp little fellow
to her breast with a sob of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Mamma is here, my baby. Did you think
mamma never, never would come?”</p>

<p>The child snuggled close in her arms, too
exhausted to utter a word.</p>

<p>“Look up, dearest; mamma has you!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Smile, mother’s darling, mamma has found
her lost baby.”</p>

<p>“Yes, praise God! You’ve found your boy,
Mrs. Rowe, and found him not one minute
too soon,” muttered Captain Bradstreet, throwing
up the windows. “If he had not made
himself heard, he might have shared the fate
of Ginevra.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Captain Bradstreet,”
shuddered Mrs. Rowe. “The story of Ginevra
flashed into my mind the moment I
discovered where Donald was.”</p>

<p>“Who was Ginevra, anyway, Molly?” asked
Kirke, a little later.</p>

<p>The Captain and Pauline had gone, Mr.
Rowe had come home, and the color was
returning to Donald’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t you know, Kirke? Why, Ginevra
was that gay young bride,—Italian, I
believe,—who ran off after her wedding, and
hid herself in a chest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“What did she do that for?”</p>

<p>“Why just for fun, to make the guests
hunt for her. They were all playing hide-and-go-seek.”</p>

<p>“Well, what next, Molly?”</p>

<p>“And the chest had a spring-lock.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the springiest kind of a spring-lock;
and the poor little bride was no sooner inside
the chest than the lid snapped down on her.
There she had to stay; and she wasn’t found
for a hundred years?”</p>

<p>“A hundred years!” echoed Weezy, in
dismay. “O Molly! didn’t she have anything
to eat for a whole hundred years?”</p>

<p>“I guess she didn’t want anything to eat,
Weezy,” said Kirke, with a sly wink at Molly.
“Not toward the last of it, anyway. I guess
she had lost her appetite.”</p>

<p>“O Kirke! you wretched boy,” said Molly.</p>

<p>But Kirke’s shocking sarcasm had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
quite lost on Weezy. She had picked up a
box-cover from the floor, and was fanning
Donald as he lay across his mother’s lap.
“Did you think that was a truly, <i>truly</i> little
bed, Donald?”</p>

<p>Donald nodded drowsily.</p>

<p>“Babies shouldn’t go to sleep in trunks.
Oh, you droll, droll little brother!”</p>

<p>Weezy’s remark had called up a painful
memory, and Donald’s lip began to quiver.</p>

<p>“Don’t wike p’itty ’itty bed. All dark.
Mamma all gone.”</p>

<p>“We won’t talk about it, darling,” said Mrs.
Rowe, kissing the tear-stained face. “Here
you are in sister’s arms, and sister shall sing
to you. What do you want to hear her sing?”</p>

<p>“Sing Robbitty-bobbitty,” replied Donald,
swallowing a sob. And Weezy piped up in
a clear, sweet treble:—</p>

<small>SANTA LUZIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Here</span> comes Miss Hobbs, mamma, rolling
along with the clothes-basket.”</p>

<p>Wednesday morning had arrived, and Kirke
was upon the side porch helping his mother
strap her grip-sack. Miss Hobbs was bringing
home some starched clothes too fine to
be laundered by Sing High, the “wash-man;”
and beside her walked her roly-poly niece
and nephew, Essie and Harry.</p>

<p>“I daren’t leave them at ’ome by their
little selves, Mrs. Rowe,” she wheezed in
mounting the steps. “Hessie is that contriving
of mischief, an’ such an obstinate
child.”</p>

<p>Essie hung her head, though not too low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to see the banana that Mrs. Rowe presently
brought her.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Hessie? For shame!
Can’t you thank the lady?”</p>

<p>“Tank oo,” mumbled Essie in the act of
skinning the fruit with her sharp little
teeth.</p>

<p>“That’s a good gell, Hessie. You and
’Arry must heat your bananas ’ere on the
porch while I carry in the clothes.</p>

<p>“If you’ll believe it, Mrs. Rowe, that
rogue of a Hessie ran away again yesterday,”
she continued, following Mrs. Rowe into the
side hall. “A beastly race she led us. She
tired ’Arry hall out.”</p>

<p>“Harry looks delicate this summer,” remarked
Mrs. Rowe, as she began to sort the
clothes into piles.</p>

<p>“’Arry’s fat, Mrs. Rowe, but he isn’t
rugged. If I could lay ’ands on the gold
I’ve buried I’d take him away for his ’ealth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Why can’t Miss Hobbs get her gold,
mamma?” whispered Weezy, coming in just
then. “Can’t Kirke and I dig it up for
her?”</p>

<p>“Miss Hobbs means, dear, that she has
spent her money for land that she cannot
sell, and so she can’t afford to take Harry
into the country this summer.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let him go to Santa Luzia
with the Rowe family,” laughed Kirke, as
his mother gave him some garments to carry
up-stairs. “Let him go, and I’ll see to him.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Master Kirke,”—Miss Hobbs’s
ample sides shook merrily,—“but while
you’re seeing to ’Arry who’ll see to you?”</p>

<p>Kirke looked nettled, especially when she
went on to say, “No, no, your ma’ll have
enough young folks to keep steady without
’aving my ’Arry.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i037">

<p class="right"><i>Page <a href="#Page_32">32</a></i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mrs. Rowe smiled thoughtfully at these
jesting remarks. A fortnight at the beach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>would doubtless be a benefit to the ailing
child. Could this be arranged? She must
consider the question.</p>

<p>“We are all fond of Harry,” she remarked,
in handing Miss Hobbs the empty basket.
“He’s a good little boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’Arry’s decent, Mrs. Rowe,” responded
Miss Hobbs, with a complacent glance at the
hall clock.</p>

<p>“The clock is too fast, Miss Hobbs.”</p>

<p>“Is she? I <i>thought</i> she must be quite
a few minutes on; but we won’t stay to hinder
you.” And Miss Hobbs tied her sunbonnet.</p>

<p>“You’ll come around again this afternoon,
Miss Hobbs, to close the house?”</p>

<p>“For certain, Mrs. Rowe. I’ll close the
’ouse, and take charge of the key.”</p>

<p>“Which key, Miss Hobbs? Hop Kee, or
door-key?” asked Kirke, with mock innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Not Hop Kee, you may rely on that,
Master Kirke,” retorted Miss Hobbs, putting
on her shawl as if it had been a bandage.
“I wouldn’t take charge of a Chinaman for
all the teapots he could break.”</p>

<p>“Hop Kee will work for the Bradstreets
while we’re away, Miss Hobbs.”</p>

<p>“So there is where he’s going. I knew
the captain’s housekeeper was sick.”</p>

<p>“And when the family move into camp,
they’ll take Hop Kee along with them.”</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet’s name had reminded
Weezy of her old grievance.</p>

<p>“O Miss Hobbs! Captain Bradstreet has
’vited Kirke and Molly to go into that camp
thing, and he hasn’t ever ’vited me,” she
complained, holding the door ajar for Miss
Hobbs to pass out. “I don’t think it’s fair.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, little woman! You’ll have
your share of hinvitations before many years,”—Miss
Hobbs gave the others a wise look.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
“I’m sorry to ’ave you all go; but I ’ope
you’ll ’ave a good summer, and I pray the
Lord’ll keep you well and ’appy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! He will; He always does,” answered
little Miss Weezy for the family. “Good-by,
Miss Hobbs.”</p>

<p>After that Harry and Essie came in with
sticky hands and faces to make their farewell
speeches; and then their Aunt Ruth waddled
homeward between them like a plump mother-duck
between two plump ducklings.</p>

<p>They were met at the corner by a handsome,
dark-eyed Spanish boy. It was Manuel
Carillo, coming to take away Kirke’s
burro and cart to keep during vacation.</p>

<p>“You’ll be good to Hoppity, this summer,
won’t you, Manuel?” said Kirke playfully,
as he helped him harness the sleek gray
burro into the trig gray cart. “You won’t
be mad with him because he threw you and
broke your leg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Mad? Oh, no! that’s all right.”</p>

<p>Manuel grinned, and slapped the limb in
question to show how strong it was.</p>

<p>“Hoppity ought to help you carry around
your newspapers to pay for that bad trick of
his. Now, oughtn’t you, Hoppity?” said
Kirke, giving the little beast a parting love-pat.</p>

<p>Kirke was glad to lend Manuel the burro.
It seemed one way of making amends for the
sad accident of the year before that had been
caused partly by his own recklessness.</p>

<p>When Kirke returned to the house the
family were sitting down to an early luncheon.
Molly made room for him beside herself,
saying cheerily,—</p>

<p>“Manuel drove by the window just now,
smiling all over his face. How much he does
think of you, Kirke!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Molly, but he
thinks a good deal of Hoppity. He’ll have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
a splendid time with the little trotter while
we’re away.”</p>

<p>“Kirke has made many friends at Silver
Gate City,” remarked his mother. “Harry
Hobbs for one.” Then, turning to Mr. Rowe,
she added, in a sprightly tone,—“Kirke proposes
doing a little missionary work during
vacation, papa. Have you any objection to
his taking care of a ‘fresh-air child’ for a
fortnight?”</p>

<p>“A ‘fresh-air child,’ my dear? I don’t
quite understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, Harry Hobbs, for instance. Harry
is in need of a change of scene. Do you
approve his coming to Santa Luzia by and
by?”</p>

<p>“O papa! I was only in fun,” exclaimed
Kirke in hot haste. “I don’t want Harry
to come; really and truly I don’t. Paul and
I have planned no end of good times there
on the beach by ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“And you think Harry wouldn’t enjoy those
good times? Is that it, my son?”</p>

<p>“No, papa; Harry would enjoy them fast
enough,” Kirke laughed and blushed; “the
bother is that Paul and I wouldn’t enjoy
<i>him</i>. The little kid would be frightfully in
the way with his mud-pies, and his tagging,
and his chattering. Don’t you see, papa?”</p>

<p>“Then, Miss Hobbs dresses Harry so oddly,
papa,” added Molly, as her father did not
reply. “She makes him look for all the
world like one of Mr. Palmer Cox’s brownies;
and people at Santa Luzia wouldn’t know
but Harry was one of our family.”</p>

<p>“What a shocking thought, Molly!” cried
Mr. Rowe, vastly entertained by her expression
of deep distress. “In the face of a danger like
this it never will do for us to take Harry.”</p>

<p>“You’re laughing at me, papa; but you
don’t understand how girls feel about such
things. Kirke doesn’t understand, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Girls have too many feelings, I think,”
said Kirke, not very politely. “They’re always
afraid of doing something queer.”</p>

<p>“I wish boys were a little more like them,
then,”—Molly pushed back her plate with a
saucy air, “boys never care a fig what is said
of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s because they’re independent, Molly.”</p>

<p>“It’s because they don’t know what is
proper, <i>I</i> say,” retorted Molly between fun
and earnest. “Why, I’ve seen boys that
would walk into church with monkeys on
their backs and never blush.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Kirke will consider you
rude, Molly,” interposed her mother gently.
“Aren’t we wandering very far from Harry?”</p>

<p>“The farther the better,” was Molly’s secret
comment, as Mrs. Rowe continued,—</p>

<p>“I hoped you children would want to do
something nice for Harry. His aunt is not
able to give him many pleasures.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“She gave him a <i>Caroline</i> cooky yesterday,
mamma,” put in Weezy; “full of seeds, it
was. Harry let me bite.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, we <i>can’t</i> take Harry with
us,” exclaimed Molly, elated by the sudden
thought; “Miss Hobbs can’t possibly get
him ready in time for the train.”</p>

<p>“As to that, Molly, she can send him next
month by Captain Bradstreet.”</p>

<p>“May be Mrs. Kitto won’t have room for
Harry,” suggested Molly faintly.</p>

<p>Kirke dashed this hope to the ground.
Harry, he affirmed, could be rolled into any
corner like a foot-ball.</p>

<p>“The question is simply this, children,”
said Mrs. Rowe, buttering a biscuit for Donald
to eat on the car; “will you devote a
part of your vacation to your little neighbor,
or will you spend the whole of it in amusing
yourselves? You shall decide.”</p>

<p>“O mamma! please don’t leave it that way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Don’t put us on our honor,” entreated Molly,
with a shrug.</p>

<p>“Because, when you put us on our honor,
we have to do a thing, even if we hate it
like poison,” added Kirke, groping under the
sideboard for the yellow kitten.</p>

<p>Kitty’s basket was ready, with a slice of
roast beef at the bottom, and a smart blue
bow on top; and now at the last moment
Ginger had refused to be put in.</p>

<p>“Head her off, Molly. Shut the door,
Weezy. Look out, Don, or I shall run over
you!”</p>

<p>Kirke shouted his orders like a general in
battle. Everybody jostled against everybody
else, and Ginger was no sooner captured than
the carriage came to take them all to the
station. Then followed the excitement of the
journey and of the arrival at Santa Luzia;
and for several days nothing further was said
about Harry Hobbs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>LEARNING TO SWIM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children were delighted with the lovely
little city of Santa Luzia, which lay upon the
coast, snuggling in its arms a placid, sunny
bay. For the first week after their arrival
Weezy never tired of watching the sails on
the water, and of counting how many she
could see from her window at “The Old and
New.”</p>

<p>“The Old and New” was Mrs. Kitto’s
boarding-house, overlooking Santa Luzia
Beach. The Old was the back part, built
of brown adobe, with walls two feet thick;
the New was the modern wooden front, with a
breezy veranda stepping down toward the sea.</p>

<p>“The house puts its best foot forward,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
prattled Molly, as she and Kirke and Weezy
set off one morning for a lesson in swimming.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Kirke, “if it
keeps steady on its pins.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,”
sniffed Weezy with disapproval. “Houses
don’t have feet; and they don’t have pins.”</p>

<p>“No, nor <i>soles</i> either, you precious snip
of a goosie.”</p>

<p>Kirke held his little sister’s hand, swinging
it to and fro as they walked together across
the beach.</p>

<p>“Are you going to squeal to-day when you
go into the water? The last time you scared
the swimming-master half out of his wits.”</p>

<p>“O Kirke, what a story!”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it to Molly if the man didn’t
duck.”</p>

<p>“You silly, silly boy! You know he
ducked on purpose.”</p>

<p>Weezy flirted her sunny head in high disdain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
while Kirke and Molly exchanged amused
glances.</p>

<p>“Do you think so, Weezy? Well, may be
he did duck on purpose. I mean to try that
ducking business myself this morning. Whatever
you do, little sister, don’t grab me around
the neck; you might pull me under.”</p>

<p>Kirke spoke in jest. He could already swim
quite well, for he had learned the art a year
or two before in the East. Molly and Weezy,
on the contrary, had only taken three lessons.</p>

<p>“Hoh, Kirke! I couldn’t pull you under.
Of course not, ’cause you’re <i>biggerer’n</i> I am,”
said Weezy, stopping to watch a small urchin
scooping ovens in the sand.</p>

<p>He was a plump little boy in “brownie”
overalls, which Molly insisted made him look
like a fat, twisted doughnut.</p>

<p>“He looks like Harry Hobbs,” responded
Kirke, hurrying Weezy on towards the bath-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Molly felt a sudden twinge of conscience.</p>

<p>“That makes me think, Kirke, what shall
we do about Harry? If he comes, he’ll have
to come next week with the Bradstreets.
Mamma has left it to us, you know, to ask
him or not, as we please.”</p>

<p>Kirke whistled, and kicked aside a tangle
of seaweed.</p>

<p>“Oh! we might as well invite the young
Britisher, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But if Harry comes, Kirke, you and I’ll
each have to keep an eye on him to”—</p>

<p>“Yes, that’ll be an eye apiece, Molly.”</p>

<p>“To see that he doesn’t get drowned or
anything.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, Miss Fidgetibus, who’s going to
drown him? You couldn’t sink that dumpy
boy any more’n you could sink the buoy on
the rock yonder.”</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t want Harry any
more than I did, Kirke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Who says I do want him? Only I was
thinking he could burrow here in all outdoors
like a gopher; and it seems sort of
mean, doesn’t it, Molly, to shut down on
the poor little kid?”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know.”</p>

<p>Molly’s glance had wandered from the
sturdy young oven-builder to a group of well-dressed
tourists climbing the long flight of
steps to the bluff overhead. How mortifying
it would be to take Harry about among
people like those, and pose as his sister.
Where <i>did</i> Miss Hobbs get the patterns of
his clothes?</p>

<p>“The beach will make Harry weller,
mamma says,” observed Weezy, always ready
to fill the pauses.</p>

<p>“<i>Better</i>, you mean, don’t you, Weezy?”
corrected Molly. “Mamma is always wanting
to make somebody better.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, ma’am,” Kirke nodded emphatically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
“Mamma is kind, way through.
She isn’t much like you and me, Molly.
Sometimes we’re kind, and then again sometimes
we’re <i>kind of not</i>.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; you can speak for yourself,
if you please,” retorted Molly, bridling.</p>

<p>She had secretly prided herself on being
unselfish and warm-hearted, and this frank
remark was wounding to her self-love.</p>

<p>“For my part, I’m willing to send for
Harry,” she added virtuously.</p>

<p>“So am I, Molly,—on a pinch,” said Kirke.
“And I suppose Pauline will bring him,—on
a pinch!”</p>

<p>“Then, as soon as we get home to The
Old and New, Kirke, we’ll ask mamma to
write to Miss Hobbs, and have it over with.”</p>

<p>“Agreed. The Bradstreets will be here
by next Thursday, won’t they? Will they
stay at The Old and New a week?”</p>

<p>“They’ll stay till the captain and Hop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Kee get Camp Hilarious in running order,”
answered Molly, as they mounted the steps
of the bath-house.</p>

<p>While Kirke presented their tickets at the
office, she and Weezy waited in the main
room. This had a large oblong bathing-tank
in the centre, surrounded on its four sides
by a broad walk. The dressing-rooms opened
upon this walk, and the door of each one
had painted on it near the top either a number
or a letter of the alphabet.</p>

<p>“Which room would you like, Molly?”
asked Kirke, quickly returning with the keys
and their bathing-suits. “You can take ‘H’
or ‘No. 7.’”</p>

<p>“No. 7; it is the larger,” said Molly, drawing
Weezy into that room, and locking the
door.</p>

<p>Kirke vanished into “H,” to reappear before
No. 7 in precisely two minutes, clad in
blue flannel, and calling,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“What! Aren’t you ready yet, girls?”</p>

<p>That was the fun of being a boy, and
having no strings and no hooks and eyes
to hinder him!</p>

<p>On emerging into the main room the children
found their father seated there awaiting
them. He had formed the habit of being
present at their swimming-lessons.</p>

<p>“I feel safer to watch my ducklings,”
Molly heard him say to Mr. Tullis, the swimming-master,
as she and Weezy drew near.</p>

<p>“Your daughters are learning fast, especially
this little one,” answered Mr. Tullis,
looking at Weezy. “She’ll soon swim like
a fish.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rowe patted Weezy’s head, shining
beneath her oiled-silk cap.</p>

<p>“She’s a venturesome little lassie,” he said.
“She never seems to know what fear is.”</p>

<p>“She’ll make all the better swimmer for
that, Mr. Rowe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Provided she doesn’t take too great risks,
Mr. Tullis. I’ve sometimes feared we ought
not to let her go into the water.”</p>

<p>“Anybody’s liable to get into water, Mr.
Rowe; the point is to know how to get
out,” replied the swimming-master lightly.</p>

<p>Molly and Kirke hardly heeded the remark
at the time, but it rang in their ears afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. Tullis was already leading Weezy down
the steps into the tank, which was divided
across the middle by a low wall of stone.
On one side of this wall the water was cold,
but on the side they were entering it was
agreeably warm; and Weezy was soon paddling
about with great glee, supported under
the chin by the strong hand of the swimming-master.</p>

<p>“Look, papa, see how well I can do it!”
she cried, splashing and puffing like a young
seal, till she was out of breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“You’d better rest a few minutes now,
little girl,” said Mr. Tullis.</p>

<p>And leaving Weezy clinging to a plank, he
went to instruct Molly in swimming.</p>

<p>Meantime Kirke had been making ludicrous
attempts to mount a hobby-horse, which,
being mostly barrel, would rear and plunge
as often as he tried to get astride its back.
Finally, tired of these fruitless efforts, he
climbed the staircase near by to coast down
the toboggan slide with some other boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowe looked on as his son dashed
down the slippery board again and again,
and dived into the tank. Then he glanced
at his more timid Molly, flushed with trying
to strike out for herself, and at little Miss
Weezy, floating gayly on her plank; and he
mused—</p>

<p>“What a blessing it is to be young and
strong! I wish my children could appreciate
this, and could know how happy they are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>And at that very moment Kirke and Molly
were thinking,—</p>

<p>“Won’t we have good times by and by,
after Paul and Pauline have come?”</p>

<p>And little Miss Weezy was thinking; but
she herself could hardly have told what she
was thinking.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I wonder</span> what you’ll think of our camp,
Molly.”</p>

<p>Pauline and Molly were swinging in a hammock
on the front veranda of The Old and
New, chattering like spring chickadees.</p>

<p>The Bradstreets had arrived from Silver
Gate City the previous evening, bringing
Harry Hobbs with them; and Captain Bradstreet
had gone on to the canyon that morning
with Hop Kee.</p>

<p>“Papa has a wooden building up there,—sort
of a shanty, where he stores the furniture
every winter,” went on Pauline. “It is
near to Mr. Arnesten’s cottage, and Mr.
Arnesten sees to things when papa is away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Are the Arnestens all the neighbors you
have, Pauline?”</p>

<p>“Yes, unless you count the Wassons. But
the Wassons are three miles away, on papa’s
bee-ranch. We’ll go to see them, Molly, when
you’re at the camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be delightful!” Molly pushed
her heavy auburn hair away from her face,
a habit of hers when things pleased her.</p>

<p>“Right after breakfast every morning,
Molly, we’ll put on our sunbonnets,—you
can borrow auntie’s,—and we’ll march over
to Mr. Arnesten’s for the eggs, and see him
feed the chickens. He has turkeys besides,
and one proud old gobbler that struts about
as if he owned all the gold mines of California.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say the Arnestens had a little
girl, Pauline?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Olga, the old-fashionedest little soul!
She has eyes just the color of a grindstone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
but her lashes are yellow, and her skin is
yellow too. She used to trudge over with
buttermilk last summer.”</p>

<p>“Then the Arnestens have a cow?”</p>

<p>“I should say they do! It’s always breaking
into the garden and eating up the pease.
We mind that, because Mr. Arnesten supplies
us with vegetables.”</p>

<p>“And with chickens too, I suppose, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Hop Kee cooks chickens beautifully.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he? It seems odd enough, Pauline,
to think of your having our Chinaman.”</p>

<p>“He came to our house in just the right
time, Molly. Mrs. Cannon was so sick she
couldn’t have worked for us another day.”</p>

<p>“Hop Kee is a diamond, Polly.”</p>

<p>“A topaz, you mean, dear, a yellow topaz.
How we shall hate to give him back to
you!”</p>

<p>Molly snuggled her dimpled chin into her
friend’s neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“I wouldn’t worry about that, Pauline. We
sha’n’t go home these two months.”</p>

<p>“Neither shall we, I hope. Papa told me
yesterday that we should stay in the canyon
all during vacation. Then, if Uncle John isn’t
back from the East, auntie will go home
with us to Silver Gate City.”</p>

<p>“I’m just longing to see your Auntie David.
Are you sure she’ll come to-day, Pauline?”</p>

<p>“She wrote that she should come to-day,
and spend a week here at The Old and New
with Paul and me. Papa can take us all out
to the camp together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, Polly! you won’t be here but
just seven days. And I haven’t entertained
you at all. What shall we do this afternoon?
Shall we go to the bath-house?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather fish,” answered Pauline promptly.
“If there’s anything I dote on, it’s fishing.”</p>

<p>“I want to fish,” cried Harry Hobbs, from
the corner of the veranda. “Can’t I fish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The little newcomer was tired of stringing
sea-shells with Weezy. Sewing was girls’
work.</p>

<p>“Don’t you and Weezy want to dig in the
sand?” asked Molly, in her sweetest tones.
“I’ll find you the dearest little pails and
shovels.”</p>

<p>“I can dig at ’ome,” responded Harry, with
a grieved look. But he did not tease Molly.
He had promised his Aunt Ruth that he
wouldn’t be troublesome.</p>

<p>“Oh! let him go fishing, Molly,” said Pauline,
stepping out of the hammock. “And
let’s ask the boys too. They’ll take care of
him.”</p>

<p>“If they can leave their stilts, Pauline.
They’re stalking round the back yard like—like”—</p>

<p>“Like storks, of course,” concluded Pauline,
leaning over the veranda rail to see the lads
better. “Come, boys, won’t you go fishing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Do you want to, Paul?” asked Kirke
aside; for was not Paul his especial chum?</p>

<p>Paul nodded, and strode to the back porch
in order to dismount on its high platform.</p>

<p>“Paul and I’ll meet the rest of you at the
wharf, Molly,” called Kirke, already upon the
ground. “You’ll take the fishing-tackle, won’t
you? We’ll bring the bait.”</p>

<p>The bait was little crawfishes. The boys
had to buy these of an old fisherman on the
flats, who kept a supply of live ones in a pail
covered with wet seaweed.</p>

<p>“It’s fun to see Mr. Tarbox catch the crawfish,”
said Paul, when they were near the
fish-house. “I saw him do it last summer.”</p>

<p>“How does he go to work?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he treads a circle about six feet
across in the mud. Pretty soon the water
soaks into this ring, and the little crawfish’ll
crawl in. All Mr. Tarbox has to do is to
scoop them up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“That’s why he can afford to sell them
cheap,” said Kirke.</p>

<p>“But he asks more in the winter,” said
Paul.</p>

<p>Kirke bought two dozen crawfish for a
nickel; and he and Paul carried them back to
the beach, where the girls and Harry were
waiting.</p>

<p>After the hooks had been baited, the three
boys and the three girls walked out upon the
wharf, Molly holding Harry by the hand.
He was a clumsy little fellow, and she was
afraid he might fall over the edge. She had
no such fear for nimble-footed Weezy. Then
they threw in their lines, and waited and
waited, while the sun grew hotter and hotter.
They waited in vain. Nobody had a nibble.</p>

<p>At last Pauline reeled in her line with a
petulant motion.</p>

<p>“Supposing we give up fishing, and go
around Bird Rocks to hunt for abalones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“A good idea,” said Paul. “The tide is
low, and maybe we can find abalones enough
for a soup to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“A soup, indeed! <i>Will</i> you hear the boy?”
cried lively Pauline. “Paul thinks only of
soup, and not at all of the beauty of the
shells.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have one large abalone shell
than forty herrings,” said Molly, escorting
Harry to the mainland.</p>

<p>“Especially than forty herrings that won’t
be caught,” added Kirke, dropping his tackle
into the basket. “Perhaps we shall have better
luck after the tide begins to come in.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. We’ll try again later,”
said Pauline, lingering at the end of the wharf
while Kirke concealed the basket beneath it.</p>

<p>Then the two hastened forward to overtake
Paul and Molly, who had set out for the rocky
cave beyond Bird Rocks. Weezy and Harry
lagged behind the others, Harry’s short fat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
legs being already weary of ploughing through
the sand.</p>

<p>Weezy was very polite to her little guest,
and very proud to show him the wonders of
Santa Luzia, which she seemed to regard as
the especial property of herself and her
family.</p>

<p>“This is one of our owl shells,” said she
presently, bringing Harry a limpet shell
about as large as the palm of her hand.</p>

<p>Harry eyed it sharply.</p>

<p>“Where’s the <i>howl</i>?”</p>

<p>“On the inside. Don’t you see, Harry?”</p>

<p>“That? That isn’t a <i>howl</i>. It hasn’t any
’ead, Weezy.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it has, Harry. I think it has
a good head, a very good head indeed.”</p>

<p>What did Harry mean by finding fault
with her lovely shell? For a moment Weezy
was too vexed to remember that he was her
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>By this time the others had passed beyond
the ledge which shut off the beach from the
rocky cove, and Harry and Weezy were
alone on the sandy shore. Before them was
the ocean, behind them the high bluff,
climbed by a wooden stairway. Near the
foot of this stairway stood the wharf where
the children had just been fishing.</p>

<p>Weezy looked back at the wharf regretfully.
She wished that she had stayed there,
instead of walking on the tiresome beach
with a little boy only six years old,—a tiny
boy that didn’t like her owl shells!</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t she go back now to the
wharf? Nobody had said she mustn’t; and
if she should go that minute nobody <i>could</i>
say it, because there was nobody to see
her. She would catch a big herring all her
own self, that she would, and make everybody
stare.</p>

<p>Weezy’s eyes sparkled like the waves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the sunlight, her cheeks glowed like the
beach pea-blossoms at her feet.</p>

<p>“I’m going to fish, Harry. You can come
if you want to,” said she, turning briskly on
her heel.</p>

<p>She wore that day a cap and dress of
navy blue trimmed with bands of gilt braid.
Harry was dressed in brown, and as he
bobbed along behind her he resembled a
dorbug chasing a butterfly.</p>

<p>“Here’s a hook with a baby crawfish on
it, Harry. <i>You</i> may have that,” she said,
with an excited air.</p>

<p>Then, having selected a second baited hook
for herself, she skipped along the wharf,
swinging her line. This was something
worth while, to fish on her own account,
without Molly or Kirke at her elbow to cry
out,—</p>

<p>“Take care, Weezy, don’t stick the hook
into you. Take care, Weezy, don’t fall overboard.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
She hated “don’ts.” She was vexed
now to hear Harry calling out, yards behind
her,—</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> go so fast, Weezy, I’m hawful
scared!”</p>

<p>He had reached a broad crack that
yawned between the planks, and there he
stood trembling till Weezy danced back to
him.</p>

<p>“O Harry, before I’d be such a baby!
Come along, I’ll lead you.”</p>

<p>But once having seen the waves tossing
beneath that dreadful crack, Harry could not
be persuaded to cross it; and much against
her will Weezy stayed beside him, and fished
near the shore.</p>

<p>“You can hold on to the post, Harry,”
she said generously. “I don’t want it, I’m
not afraid.”</p>

<p>Harry held on like a barnacle while Weezy
sat on the edge of the wharf, dangling her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
feet, and moving her line slowly up and down
in the way she had seen fishermen do.</p>

<p>The beach was unusually deserted that
afternoon, because of a railway excursion
which had attracted many people to the
neighboring city. Weezy, sitting and gazing
down into the restless green water, while
she waited in vain for a nibble, began to
grow sleepy. Suddenly Harry shouted boisterously,—</p>

<p>“I’ve caught a fish, Weezy! Oh, oh! I’ve
caught a fish!”</p>

<p>Weezy was at once broad awake.</p>

<p>“Have you, Harry? Oh, have you? Let
me pull him in.”</p>

<p>She spoke a second too late. Harry had
given the line a quick jerk toward her, and
the next thing she knew a wriggling sculpin
was flapping its slimy scales right in her
face.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh! Take it away, Harry!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
she cried, dropping her own line, and beating
the fish back with both hands. “Oh,
take the horrid”—</p>

<p>She never finished the sentence. At the
last word she lost her balance, and toppled
headlong into the ocean.</p>

<small>FISHING FOR WEEZY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Weezy’s</span> fall had been to Harry like the
rushing of a meteor across the sky. He had
seen a swiftly moving mass of gilt and blue
dart past him and vanish, and the next thing
he knew he was standing alone upon the
wharf.</p>

<p>For a moment he was too dazed to move;
then he scampered madly to the shore, trailing
the sculpin after him.</p>

<p>“Weezy’s tumbled! Weezy’s tumbled into
the water,” he shrieked, running toward The
Old and New as fast as he could run.</p>

<p>The more direct way was by the one hundred
steps which led to the bluff; but Harry
never thought of the steps, he toiled around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
by the carriage-road. Twice he tripped, and
measured his short length in the sand; but
fortunately his screams went on ahead of him,
and reached Mrs. Rowe up-stairs in her room.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Harry? What is it?” she
cried, hastening to the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>“Come, oh, please come!” sobbed the terrified
little fellow. “She’s in it. Oh, she’s
in it!”</p>

<p>“Who’s in it? In what, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Weezy, Weezy’s in it—in the ocean! I
didn’t push her in!”</p>

<p>“Where, Harry? Show me.”</p>

<p>“She tumbled in, she tumbled in her own
self.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe had seized the child’s hand,
and was dragging him back to the beach.
Behind him still trailed the forgotten sculpin,
now dead as a door-nail.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” shrieked Mrs. Rowe, as she
pressed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>She was trembling all over. She dared not
ask another question. A man hauling seaweed
from the shore left his horses standing
in the middle of the highway, and turned
back with her.</p>

<p>Ah, the long, long hill! Should they never,
never reach the foot of it? Midway Harry
tripped again and fell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe rushed forward alone. She had
caught a glimpse of a small object floating
near the beach. It was Weezy’s cap riding
the waves like a little skiff. Yes, certainly
it was Weezy’s cap,—the blue cap with gilt
bands; but, alas! alas! where was the little
girl who so lately had worn it? Where, oh,
where was Weezy herself?</p>

<p>Not to pain you needlessly, my little readers,
I will tell you in confidence that Weezy
was out of the water, safe and well. But
how could poor Mrs. Rowe know this? She
only knew that her darling was not with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the four other children now returning from
Rocky Cove, and she called distractedly to
Harry,—</p>

<p>“Show me just where Weezy fell in.”</p>

<p>“Hoff there,”—he pointed at random
along the pier,—“hoff there, by the post.”</p>

<p>“Which post, my boy?” cried the ranchman.
“There are forty or fifty posts.”</p>

<p>Harry grew confused; he could not answer.</p>

<p>“I’ll row out a piece,” said the man,
hurriedly untying a punt moored to the
beach.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I call Edward! Oh, if Edward
were here!” moaned Mrs. Rowe, rushing
upon the wharf, and peering over the
side.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any kelp to hinder my seeing
to the bottom, ma’am,” cried the ranchman
from the boat below.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe wrung her hands. “O Weezy,
Weezy, my dear little daughter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“If I only knew just where she slipped
in, I’d dive for her,” called the pitying voice
from beneath. “I’d get her for you if I
could, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile little Miss Weezy, the unconscious
cause of all this anguish and commotion,
lay half asleep upon the neighboring
bluff behind some tall tufts of alfalfa.</p>

<p>She had scrambled out of the ocean almost
as quickly as she had fallen in. Then she
had started to run home, but, at the top of
the one hundred steps, had become giddy
and sunk down to rest. Oh, she was so
tired, so very, very tired! And it was so
nice and warm on the bluff. To go on to
The Old and New seemed too great an
effort; it was easier to lie still in the sunshine.
Besides, didn’t she want to dry her
wet clothes? What would mamma say to
her because she had spoiled her pretty
dress? By and by she opened her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and blinked at the wharf below. She saw
her mother rushing up and down the planks,
she saw the teamster pushing off from shore.</p>

<p>“Wonder what makes mamma act so
funny? Wonder what that man’s doing
with the boat?” she thought drowsily. But
she was too languid really to care; and in
the act of wondering again closed her eyes.</p>

<p>She did not see Kirke race to the pier to
learn what was the matter; she did not hear
her mamma cry,—</p>

<p>“Oh, Kirke, Kirke, your little sister’s in
the ocean!”</p>

<p>But when Kirke took in the full meaning
of his mother’s words and shouted, half beside
himself,—</p>

<p>“O Molly, O Paul, Weezy’s drowning!
Weezy’s drowning in the ocean!” then
Weezy sprang to her feet wide awake,—</p>

<p>“O Kirke Rowe, that’s a fib, that’s a
dreadful fib!” she cried, whirling about, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
waving her arms like an excited windmill.
“I’m not drowned one bit! Why, see me,
here I am, right here!”</p>

<p>I wish you could have heard the shout
that answered her from the shore. I wish
you could have seen the sudden rush from the
wharf, and the dash up those wooden steps!</p>

<p>Regardless of salt and sand, Mrs. Rowe
clasped her dripping child to her breast, and
then passed her about like some choice relic
to be kissed and adored.</p>

<p>“You did fall in the <i>hocean</i> though,
Weezy; I saw you!” cried Harry, evidently
bent on clearing himself from any suspicion
of having lied.</p>

<p>Weezy turned to her mother with a most
contrite air,—</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to, mamma, truly I didn’t!
That wiggly old fish jumped at me and
knocked me off!”</p>

<p>“Bless my sweet little girlie!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Mrs. Rowe, taking the child again in her arms,
“did you think mamma was going to scold
you?”</p>

<p>Weezy looked very happy. In place of the
chiding she had expected for losing her cap
and soiling her gown, she had received hugs
and kisses. The reason for this strange state
of things she did not in the least understand;
but she knew that she liked it. That she
had been in danger of drowning never once
occurred to her.</p>

<p>“Walk as fast as you can, darling,” cried
her mamma, leading her on toward the boarding-house.
“You must have a hot bath and
a good rubbing at once, or you’ll take cold.”</p>

<p>“My shoes go <i>quish, quish</i>, every step I
take,” complained Weezy, pressing forward
with lagging feet.</p>

<p>“Wait, we’ll carry you, Weezy. Kirke and
I will make a queen’s chair and carry you,”
exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>“To be sure we will, little water-soaked
girl; why didn’t I think of it?” returned
Kirke, wheeling about to clasp hands with
his comrade.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe lifted Weezy into the seat thus
formed, and the boys bore the child onward.
The others followed.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t look much like Weezy’s hair,
does it, Pauline?” said Molly, wringing the
moist locks that straggled down her little
sister’s back. “It looks more like seaweed
than hair.”</p>

<p>“Or more like wet sewing-silk, Molly. Not
a speck of curl in it.”</p>

<p>“You must have gone to the very bottom,
Weezy,” said Kirke tremulously, as they neared
The Old and New. “How on earth did you
manage to paddle out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, when I came up, you know, I just
climbed into the punt.”</p>

<p>“The punt! Why, the punt was ever so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
far from the shore, Weezy,” interrupted Molly.
“I remember ’twas tied by a long rope.”</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty long,” said Weezy.</p>

<p>“Then how did you get from the boat to
the beach, Weezy, so far off?” persisted Kirke.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>that</i> was as easy as pie,” said Weezy,
highly flattered at finding herself the object
of so much interest. “I just took hold of
the rope, you see.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say, Weezy, that you
slid from the bow of the boat into the water,
and then worked yourself ashore by that
rope?”</p>

<p>“Yes; why not, Kirke? The rope was right
there.”</p>

<p>“She has no idea she did anything remarkable,”
exclaimed Molly in Kirke’s ear. “Just
think what might have happened! We ought
to have kept those children in sight every
minute.”</p>

<p>Kirke nodded penitently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“That’s so; but Weezy would have done
well enough if Harry hadn’t been there. Why
did we bring him?” he whispered. Then
aloud, “I can’t imagine now how the little
witch got to land. It isn’t as if she had
actually learned to swim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I pinched the rope, and kind of jiggled
along,” explained Weezy coolly; “that wasn’t
anything.”</p>

<p>“No, of course it wasn’t anything,” said
Paul and Pauline in chorus, clapping their
hands and laughing.</p>

<p>But the drenched little girl who had performed
so grandly on the tight rope was
growing more exhausted now with every step
she took; and the moment she entered the
house was glad to be undressed, and put to
bed like a baby.</p>

<p>When it was the hour for the train the
other children left her sleeping, and stole off to
the station together to meet “Auntie David.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Harry trudged behind, hugging Weezy’s
damp cap, which had been rescued from the
billows.</p>

<p>“Little John Bull has nothing to say,” remarked
Kirke to Pauline, who walked beside
him. “I think he misses Weezy.”</p>

<p>“We all miss her,” responded Pauline, with
a glance over her shoulder. “Harry makes
up the number five; but he doesn’t take
Weezy’s place in the least. Without Weezy
we can’t be ‘The Merry Five.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>GOING INTO CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children met Mrs. Davidson at the
station as they had expected.</p>

<p>She was a cheery little woman, with a
delicate pink skin and soft light brown hair,
so full of waves that Pauline sportively declared
that it made her seasick to look at it.</p>

<p>Paul and Pauline were very fond of this
aunt, and found it one of the greatest attractions
of their camp-life that she usually spent
her summers with them.</p>

<p>“And the best of it is, Molly, that Auntie
David loves us just as well as we love her,”
chatted Pauline, the last morning of her stay
at Santa Luzia.</p>

<p>The two girls were pacing arm-in-arm up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and down the veranda, waiting for Captain
Bradstreet to drive around with the buckboard
in which he was to take his family
to the canyon.</p>

<p>“I think your Auntie David is perfectly
lovely, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Do you, really? Oh, I’m so glad! She
likes you too, Molly. She hopes you’ll come
out often to the camp.”</p>

<p>“Does she? The dear, how nice of her!”</p>

<p>“Yes; she says you’re a reliable girl,
Molly. She never said as much of her own
niece! and,—ahem!—she believes you have
a good influence over me!”</p>

<p>Pauline drawled out the last sentence with
a droll pucker of the lips which threw Molly
into spasms of laughter.</p>

<p>“The blessed woman! She didn’t say
that, Pauline? You don’t mean to tell me
that your Auntie David said that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, those very words, Molly, to papa.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
And papa, the old darling, whipped out his
pocket-handkerchief, wiped his eyes, and muttered,
‘I’ve noticed that myself.’”</p>

<p>“Now, Pauline!”</p>

<p>“Oh! papa is forever holding you up to
me for an example, Molly. I wonder I don’t
hate you.”</p>

<p>“The idea of setting me up for an example
for anybody, Polly,—me, a girl with
a red-haired temper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, Molly! Your hair isn’t red!”</p>

<p>“It used to be when I was a little midget,—a
real cayenne-pepper color, and I had a
peppery temper to match.”</p>

<p>“What has become of it, then, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Of my hair, do you mean? That has
cooled off, but my temper”—</p>

<p>“The stage is ready,” shouted Captain Bradstreet,
reining his prancing horses around
the corner of The Old and New. “Call
your aunt, Pauline.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Weezy, still a trifle pale, ran out upon the
veranda with Harry to witness the departure.
Paul and Kirke raced up from the beach.
Mrs. Davidson came down from her room,
and mounted with Pauline to the back seat
of the buckboard; Paul jumped in at the
front beside his father, quick good-bys were
exchanged, and away dashed the lively horses
on the road to the canyon.</p>

<p>“Thursday, remember we shall expect you
next Thursday, all three of you,” cried the
twins, looking backward.</p>

<p>“All three of you, of course,” echoed their
father, in tones loud enough to have been
heard at sea. “We want <i>all</i> of you, especially
little Miss Weezy.”</p>

<p>Weezy darted into the house, about the
happiest little girl in California, shouting,—</p>

<p>“He <i>did</i> ’vite me, mamma! Captain Bradstreet
<i>did</i> ’vite me. He ’vited me <i>officially</i>!
Oh! please may I go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“We’ll see, dear,” answered her mother,
with a smile that meant “yes”; “we’ll see
how kind and polite you are to Harry for
the rest of his stay.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe had suspected all along that the
good captain had intended to include Weezy
in the invitation, but had forgotten to mention
the child by name. Grown people are
careless sometimes, and forget that little children
have been slighted. The children themselves
do not forget—ah, no!</p>

<p>Harry remained at Santa Luzia one week
longer, and the members of the family vied
with one another in making him happy. Mr.
Rowe bought him a new suit, which delighted
Molly as much as it did Harry;
Kirke caught horned toads, and dug up trap-door
spiders’ nests for the lad’s amusement;
while little Miss Weezy loaded him with
shells and sand-dollars till his new pockets
were in danger of bursting. By the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
his fortnight at The Old and New they had
all grown fond of the frank little fellow, as
we are apt to grow fond of those whom we
try to make happy. When he was put on
the train in care of the conductor, Weezy
cried, and even Molly looked tearful.</p>

<p>“We shall miss the little scamp, Molly,”
said Kirke, as they walked home from the
station; “but I must confess I’m tired of
playing watch-dog for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so am I, Kirke,” Molly drew a
long breath; “I’m glad we asked him to
come, though. Mamma thinks the visit has
helped him ever so much.”</p>

<p>“Does she? Well, I’m glad. But do
you know, Molly, this morning I was afraid
it would rain, and the kid would have to
stay over? If he had stayed, it would have
bothered us to-morrow about going to the
camp.”</p>

<p>Kirke blew off some of his surplus energy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in a prolonged whistle, the near prospect of
this much desired outing being very exciting.</p>

<p>But, sad to relate, when the children went
down to breakfast the next morning, yesterday’s
light mist was woven into a thick
curtain of fog, which shut out the sun, the
ocean, and even the hedge that bordered the
lawn. Molly opened the front door, and immediately
closed it with a shiver.</p>

<p>“O Kirke! out-of-doors it’s like a vapor
bath. Do you suppose papa can take us to
the canyon?”</p>

<p>“Papa must take us; papa promised!”
exclaimed Weezy, her eyes watering as if the
fog had condensed in them.</p>

<p>“But you know it never will do for papa
to get cold, Weezy,” returned Molly, herself
ready to cry. “If it isn’t pleasant to-day, we
can go when it clears off. Wasn’t it nice in
Captain Bradstreet to ask us to stay a long
while?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Oh! the fog will lift by and by, Molly.
Here in California mist doesn’t mean rain,”
said hopeful Kirke.</p>

<p>For once he was a true prophet. By ten
o’clock the sun had pierced the clouds; and
by eleven the little party set forth in a beach
wagon, attended by Zip, Donald’s hairless
Mexican dog. Turning their backs upon the
blue ocean, they drove across the parched
<i>mesa</i>, descended a steep hill, and found themselves
at the lower end of Sylvan Canyon.
Here the grass was still tender and juicy,
watered by a lazy brook flowing between dwarf
forests of fern. Molly clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“How pretty it is, papa! so green and so
tree-y!”</p>

<p>“The trees are mostly live-oaks and sycamores,”
replied her father, who had driven
over the road the week before with Captain
Bradstreet. “Look out for the branches,
or you’ll lose your caps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“I’d like to lose mine,” responded Weezy
rather fretfully. “It pinches, and it’s all
crumpled up.”</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind, little sister,”—Molly
brushed some grains of sand from the visor;
“the cap is plenty good enough for the
woods.”</p>

<p>Here Zip began to bark and whine around
the wagon; and before anybody could tell
what he wanted he had jumped in, trembling
like a leaf.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of those dogs,” said Molly,
the next moment, as a pack of hounds came
running toward them, followed by a man in
a rough hunting-suit.</p>

<p>“No wonder he’s afraid,” exclaimed Kirke,
rapidly counting. “One, two, three,—eight
big creatures! And the smallest of them
could eat Zip at a mouthful.”</p>

<p>“Their master is Kit Carson’s son,” observed
Mr. Rowe, when they had passed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
strange procession. “He lives in that hut
behind the willows.”</p>

<p>“Does Cat Carson live with him, papa?”
asked Weezy.</p>

<p>“No, little daughter; Kit Carson died years
ago, but he was a famous scout in his day.”</p>

<p>“What is a <i>cout</i>, papa?”</p>

<p>“A scout, Weezy, is a man sent before an
army to spy out danger.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is that all?” yawned Weezy, tired of
the subject.</p>

<p>“Kit Carson led General Frémont through
to the Pacific Ocean, didn’t he, papa?” asked
Kirke.</p>

<p>“Yes, my son, when the country was an
unexplored wilderness.”</p>

<p>While they talked, the road had been running
about among the trees in an inquisitive
way, as if it were hunting for birds’ nests;
and now it crossed a small clearing where
there was a brown cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“This is Mr. Arnesten’s ranch,” said Mr.
Rowe, drawing the reins.</p>

<p>“I see the camp, I see it!” cried Kirke,
standing up in the wagon. “There are three—yes,
<i>four</i>—tents, and a shed besides.”</p>

<p>“Hop Kee sleeps in the shed,” said Mr.
Rowe. “Ah, here comes Mr. Arnesten from
the spring. Good-morning, Mr. Arnesten.
Can you bring back my horses from the
camp and feed them?”</p>

<p>The Swede nodded respectfully, and having
set down his two pails of water, plodded
along in his clumsy shoes behind the party.</p>

<p>“Look, Weezy, they’ve carried the table
out-of-doors under the live-oaks,” exclaimed
Molly, holding Zip by the collar. “We shall
have a regular gypsy dinner.”</p>

<p>“I hope dinner is ready,” said Weezy, in
a flutter of expectancy. “I’m ’most starved.”</p>

<p>Molly was gazing about her with an air of
keen disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Where can Paul and Pauline be, Kirke?
I thought they’d be looking out for us.”</p>

<p>“And aren’t we looking? and haven’t we
been looking for an hour?” cried two gay
voices on the right, as the twins sprang
from behind the tall sycamore that had concealed
them.</p>

<p>Then they started three cheers for “The
Merry Five,” in which their young visitors
most lustily joined.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy! Cast your anchor!” called
genial Captain Bradstreet, drawn from his
tent by the joyful tumult.</p>

<p>Auntie David hurried after to shake hands
with the newcomers, and bid them welcome
to the camp. All were talking and laughing
together, and making so pleasant a din that
the sleepy old owl at the top of the sycamore
actually winked at them, and cocked
his head on one side to listen.</p>

<small>THE LITTLE MINERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pauline</span> raised the green mosquito-netting
that screened the door of the largest tent,
and courtesied demurely to her visitors.</p>

<p>“‘Will you walk into my parlor?’”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Fly,” said Molly, “‘’Tis
the prettiest little parlor that ever I did
spy.’”</p>

<p>The canvas room was indeed very attractive,
as well as comfortable. It had a board
floor carpeted with rugs, and it boasted a
lounge and a table and several rocking-chairs.</p>

<p>“You and Weezy are going to sleep with
Auntie David and me in the little room
behind those, Molly,” said Pauline hospitably,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
pointing to a pair of gaudy blankets
curtaining off the farther end of the tent.
“Papa bought those blankets of the Navajo
Indians. Aren’t they gay?”</p>

<p>“Who, Pauline? The Indians?” asked
Kirke slyly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Indians are gay. I think
they are sober as a—as a cow!” said outspoken
Weezy, who had not understood
Kirke’s joke in the least.</p>

<p>“Pauline was talking about the blankets,
Ducksie,” said Molly, smoothing her little
sister’s hair. “But what makes you think
that Indians are sober? You’ve never known
any Indians.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly Rowe, that isn’t a <i>so</i> story.
I’ve seen half a hundred Indians,—well, <i>six</i>,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Where, Weezy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the streets and ’round; and in the
curious store.” (Weezy meant curio store.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
“Don’t you remember that curious store
where mamma bought the funny jugs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do remember now. There
<i>were</i> some Indians there with baskets to
sell; and the storekeeper wouldn’t buy them.
Perhaps that made the Indians sober.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they were sober because they
weren’t drunk,” suggested Paul. “Hark! Hop
Kee is blowing the conch-shell. Dinner is
ready.”</p>

<p>The dinner was a charming woodland meal,
served in the open air, on a long table
decked with ferns and fragrant bay-leaves.
Captain Bradstreet sat on a bench on one
side of the table between Molly and Pauline,
and Weezy sat on the other side between
Paul and Kirke. Mr. Rowe and Mrs. Davidson
occupied chairs at opposite ends of the
table.</p>

<p>“Brother insists on giving me a seat with
a back, Mr. Rowe,” remarked Mrs. Davidson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
with a smile as sunny as the California
weather. “He pets me, but I have known
how to ‘rough it’ as well as anybody.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was a wild country when
you settled on this coast, Mrs. Davidson.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it was, Mr. Rowe,”—Mrs. Davidson
laughed softly,—“you can’t conceive
what a contrast it seemed to Philadelphia, our
native city.”</p>

<p>“Father moved out here not long after
gold was first discovered in the State,” said
Captain Bradstreet, as Hop Kee carried around
the plates of soup. “My sister was a little girl
in pinafores, and I was only two years older.”</p>

<p>“Our father was a doctor,” continued Mrs.
Davidson, passing the crackers; “his health
had failed, and he came out here to Tuolumne
county, and built an adobe house for
us to live in. Do you recollect those heavy
shutters, Alec, that papa used to bar every
night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Perfectly well, Almeda.”</p>

<p>“O Auntie David! please tell them how
you and papa used to mine the gold,” cried
Pauline.</p>

<p>“I am sure we should all like to hear the
story, Mrs. Davidson,” said Mr. Rowe.</p>

<p>“It’s not much of a story, Mr. Rowe.
Ours was placer mining. They did not dig
deep into the earth for gold in those early
days, you know. They took the gold from
the surface, and used cradles.”</p>

<p>“What did the babies do without them,
Mrs. Davidson?” demanded listening Weezy.</p>

<p>“Oh, the miners did not use the babies’
cradles, little Miss Weezy; they had cradles
of their own,” interrupted Captain Bradstreet,
smiling, as he helped her to fricasseed rabbit.</p>

<p>“Each cradle,” went on Mrs. Davidson,
“had a tin pan in its upper part full of holes
like a colander. The miners would shovel
dirt into this pan, and then pour on water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
and rock the cradle. The water would wash
the dirt through the holes, and leave the bits
of gold behind in the pan.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t the gold good for anything, Mrs.
Davidson?” asked Weezy.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,”—Mrs. Davidson wiped away
a smile with her napkin,—“and the miners
gathered up all that was left in the pan; but
gold was so plenty at that time that they
did not trouble themselves to save any little
pieces that might have escaped through the
holes.”</p>

<p>“That is funny,” said Weezy.</p>

<p>“It was wasteful, wasn’t it, my dear?
They don’t do that way nowadays. Well,
every night there would be heaps of moist
dirt under the cradles,—‘tailings’ they called
it; and after the miners had gone home
to their suppers, my brother and I used to
trudge along with our iron spoons to dig in it.”</p>

<p>Molly laid down her knife and fork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“How delightful, Mrs. Davidson! Did you
find much gold?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes we’d find fifty cents’ worth;
sometimes we wouldn’t find any.”</p>

<p>“But when you did find any, Mrs. Davidson,
what did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“We took a fancy to hoarding it in an old
mustard-box, Molly.”</p>

<p>“I wonder, Almeda, how many times we
carried the battered thing to that miserable
little store at the cross-roads?” interrupted
Captain Bradstreet.</p>

<p>“<i>We</i>, Alec? It was <i>you</i> that carried the
box. You used to tell me that I wasn’t big
enough to be trusted with it,” retorted Mrs.
Davidson playfully. “Nobody knows how
I’ve grieved over that.”</p>

<p>“I suspect I <i>was</i> rather lordly about keeping
possession of the gold-dust, Almeda; but
you can’t say that I didn’t give you your half
of the candy it bought.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“No; you gave me my full share, Alec.
That was not a great deal, though. Candy,
like everything else, was very dear in those
days.”</p>

<p>“And I’m inclined to believe that that
wretched storekeeper cheated us, Almeda,”
said Captain Bradstreet, removing a green
leaf that had fallen into his coffee-cup. “But
you haven’t told the children of the watch
and the sluices.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry me, Alec; I’m coming to
the sluices. These were long wooden troughs,
higher at one end than at the other. The
miners used to throw earth into them, and
then flood them. The water would wash
away the earth, and leave the gold in the
bottom of the sluices.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have stayed there long if I
had been around,” commented Kirke, sugaring
his strawberries.</p>

<p>“The miners swept up the gold, but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
didn’t clean out the cracks”—Mrs. Davidson
looked mischievously toward Mr. Rowe. “I’ve
read that men are not very fond of cleaning
out cracks.”</p>

<p>“What little gnomes we were,” said Captain
Bradstreet. “I can seem to see ourselves
now, Almeda, armed with case-knives, and
creeping through those damp sluices. Their
sides must have been nearly as high as our
heads.”</p>

<p>“I imagine I was on my hands and knees
most of the time peeping for the gold.”</p>

<p>“You could see it more quickly than I
could, Almeda; but when it came to scraping
it out of the corners, I think I could beat you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the watch, Auntie David,”
prompted Pauline.</p>

<p>“No, dearie. Are you afraid it will run
down if I linger so? Where was I?”</p>

<p>“Grandfather found the mustard-box, you
know, auntie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Thank you, Pauline. Yes; your grandfather
came across our treasure one day when
he was hunting for mustard to make a paste
for your grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Our mother was sick that spring,” explained
Captain Bradstreet; “and as a nurse
couldn’t be obtained for love or money, father
took care of mother himself, and did the cooking
for all of us. We children had enough
to eat and to wear, but we had very little
training.”</p>

<p>“We were as wild as two young quails,
Alec, I’ve”—</p>

<p>“Mustard-box, Auntie David,” interrupted
Pauline.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davidson shook her forefinger playfully
at her niece.</p>

<p>“When father saw the yellow dust inside
the box, he knew at once that it wasn’t mustard,
and he questioned us about it.”</p>

<p>“We had rather more gold than usual then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
I remember, Almeda,” added Captain Bradstreet.
“Probably the creek had risen, and
we hadn’t been able to cross over it to the
store for several days.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, Alec. Well, father said to us
that if he were in our places he wouldn’t
spend the gold for candy. He asked us if
we didn’t think it would be nicer to save all
the gold we could find, and have this made
into a present for mother.”</p>

<p>“And after that, Almeda, you and I used
to scrape the sluices and dig among the tailings
for hours together.”</p>

<p>“Did you buy your mamma the present,
Mrs. Davidson?” asked Weezy, impatient for
the end of the story.</p>

<p>“Father bought it. He sent East for it
the next spring,” answered Mrs. Davidson,
slipping a heavy gold chain from her neck as
she rose from the table.</p>

<p>“It was this watch, Weezy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>The children crowded around Mrs. Davidson
as she opened the hunter’s case, and
pointed out this inscription engraved on the
inside:—</p>

<p class="center">TO MOTHER<br>
<span class="smcap">From Alec and Almeda</span>,<br>
<i>Christmas</i>, 1852.</p>

<p>“How delighted grandma must have been
when you and papa gave her this,” said Pauline,
pressing the watch tenderly to her cheek.</p>

<p>“She was delighted indeed. She wore it
till her last illness, and then put it into my
hands as her most valued keepsake.”</p>

<p>“Dear, pretty little grandma,” sighed Pauline
gently. “Oh, I did love her so!”</p>

<p>“I know you loved her, dearie, and grandma
loved you,” said Mrs. Davidson, returning the
watch to her watch-pocket.</p>

<p>After Pauline had accompanied the others
to the parlor tent, Mrs. Davidson slipped her
arm around Molly’s waist, and whispered,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Shall I tell you a great secret, Molly,—something
that nobody else knows? On
Pauline’s eighteenth birthday I’m going to
give her this watch.”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Davidson, I’m so glad for Pauline!”</p>

<p>Molly was not only glad for Pauline, but
highly flattered by Auntie David’s confidence
in herself. When her father came to say
good-by her face was still beaming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE BEE-RANCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning Weezy ran over to Mr. Arnesten’s
to play with homely little Olga and
some fluffy young chickens; and the other
children set off for Captain Bradstreet’s bee-ranch,
three miles away.</p>

<p>“You see, it isn’t a road at all, Molly,”
said Pauline, as they followed the path leading
from the camp; “it is only the bottom
of a brook.”</p>

<p>Molly turned up the sole of her left shoe,
and carefully examined it, to Pauline’s great
amusement.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no danger of wet feet, Miss
Prudence. The path is dry all summer; but
in the winter rains the floods come tearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
down from the upper canyon where we are
going.”</p>

<p>“Then how do the people get out of the
canyon, Pauline?”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any people, Molly, besides
the Wassons. Mr. and Mrs. Wasson don’t
get out; they stay in.”</p>

<p>“All winter? Why, Polly Bradstreet, I
should think they’d be lonesome enough to
die.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the rains don’t last very long at a
time, Molly,” said Paul, helping her over a
fallen log; “and when the brook isn’t too
high Mr. Wasson can drive along the bed of
it with Punch and Judy.”</p>

<p>“Those mules are the <i>knowingest</i> little animals,”
put in Pauline enthusiastically. “Mr.
Wasson can do anything with them. Once
he drove them out to Santa Luzia with a
load of honey, when the water was up to
their knees a part of the way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“What makes the Wassons stay in the
canyon in the rainy season, Pauline?”</p>

<p>“To take care of the bees.”</p>

<p>“To take care of the bees, Pauline? What
do they do to them? You talk as if bees
had to be fed and watered like so many
cows.”</p>

<p>“Not like cows exactly, Molly; but they
do have to be fed and watered. Mr. Wasson
sows alfalfa for them to make honey
from when the wild sage blossoms are gone.
There’s Mr. Wasson now, in front of the
house.”</p>

<p>They were approaching a small cottage
which stood alone on a ranch. Before the
house were rows of square redwood boxes,
and Mr. Wasson was bending over one of
these boxes. He was thin and dark, and had
long gray hair, and heavy, arched eyebrows,
which reminded Molly of little birch canoes
turned upside down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Good-morning, Mr. Wasson,” said Pauline,
walking up to him.</p>

<p>The man straightened himself with a quick
jerk.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s the cap’n’s little girl, is it?
Plagued if you didn’t ’most scare me out of
a year’s growth.”</p>

<p>Pauline and the others laughed in concert,
for Mr. Wasson was exceedingly tall.</p>

<p>“This is Molly Rowe,” said Pauline affably;
“and this is her brother Kirke. They’re
visiting at our camp, and Paul and I have
brought them to see the ranch.”</p>

<p>“Always pleased to have folks come, particularly
young folks.—Mother,” Mr. Wasson
glanced over his shoulder and shouted,—“Hello,
mother, here’s company!”</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Wasson’s wife; he always
calls her mother,” whispered Paul to Kirke,
as a woman appeared at the door of the
house and hastily retreated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>Mr. Wasson looked at his guests with a
comical grin.</p>

<p>“Mother likes to fix herself up before
strangers come in. Women are made that
way.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we don’t want to go into the house
yet, Mr. Wasson,” interposed Molly with
ready tact. “We want to see what you are
doing to the hives.”</p>

<p>“I’m lifting the covers, miss.”</p>

<p>“To give the bees an airing, Mr. Wasson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss; I’m drying off the hives.
We’ve had drenching fogs lately, and I’m
afraid my bees will catch cold.”</p>

<p>Molly looked surprised. Kirke, less on his
good behavior, laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of a bee with a cold?”
he said. “Do they sneeze, I wonder? You
must be joking, Mr. Wasson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i121">

</figure>

<p>“Not at all. I’ve lost lots of bees with
chills. These covers I put on at night to
keep out the dampness, but I take ’em off
when the sun shines.”</p>

<p>Now that the covers had been removed,
the children could see that the top of each
hive was made of wooden slats. Mr. Wasson
pried up one of these slats to show the well-filled
honeycomb attached to it.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! there’s a little mould here,”
he said, passing his finger along the cells
without heeding the bees flying about
them.</p>

<p>Molly drew back.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid of being stung, Mr.
Wasson?”</p>

<p>“Afraid, miss? Oh, no! my bees and I
are good friends.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you ever stung, Mr. Wasson?”
asked Kirke uneasily, as a bee whizzed about
his ear.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I ever stung, sir?”—Mr. Wasson
put back the comb with an odd grimace,—“well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
young man, accidents will happen.
There are five hundred of these stands,
and I go over them three times every
spring.”</p>

<p>“Go over them, Mr. Wasson?” repeated
Molly.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss; I clean them, and make sure
that each hive has a queen. It’s no fool of
a job! The year I was sick mother tended
to them, and she hasn’t had any hands
since.”</p>

<p>Molly opened her eyes, and glanced at
Pauline.</p>

<p>“No hands to speak of, I mean, miss.
She strained ’em, I tell her, when she
strained the honey.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wasson smiled broadly at his own
jest. His smile was the only broad thing
about him.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was too bad, Mr. Wasson,” said
Molly, smiling from sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Mother’s come to the door with her
starched gown on,” he continued facetiously.
“She expects you to go in. I always do as
mother says. She’s brigadier-general, and I’m
only a private.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he odd, Molly?” whispered Pauline
as they followed Mr. Wasson along the beaten
path.</p>

<p>Molly squeezed Pauline’s hand, and Paul
and Kirke grinned.</p>

<p>They found Mrs. Wasson as short and
plump as her husband was tall and spare.
Her one straight line was her mouth, enclosed
between two curving wrinkles like a dash in
parentheses.</p>

<p>Having given the children all the chairs
the house afforded, she seated herself upon
the bed. Mr. Wasson sat upon the stove,
which, fortunately for him, had no fire.</p>

<p>But the next moment he sprang up to
bring his visitors water from the Mexican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
<i>olla</i> swinging upon the porch; and this reminded
Mrs. Wasson that they might be
hungry, and she bustled to the “cooler,” or
“window cupboard,” at the north for a loaf
of rye bread and a plate of honey.</p>

<p>Molly thought she had never eaten anything
nicer than those slices of bread spread
with ranch butter and amber honey; but
when Kirke looked longingly at a third
slice, her sense of politeness took alarm, and
she asked Pauline in a whisper if they ought
not to go.</p>

<p>Pauline arose quickly.</p>

<p>“We’ve had a splendid time, Mrs. Wasson.
Thank you ever so much for the luncheon.”</p>

<p>“We always have a splendid time here,”
added Paul, stepping over the threshold.
“What a frolic we had last summer with
Mèdor! Where is that dog, Mrs. Wasson?
I haven’t seen him to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“O Master Paul! haven’t you heard? Our
Mèdor is dead!” Mrs. Wasson brushed away
a tear with her purple calico sleeve. “Would
you like to visit his grave? It’s to the left,
under the weeping willow.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we should!” cried the twins in
a breath; “Mèdor was a dear old dog!”</p>

<p>“There never was a better,” responded
Mr. Wasson, leading the way. “He came to
us a little puppy. We lived in ’Frisco then,
on Telegraph Hill, and we’ve owned him ever
since.”</p>

<p>“Father says if he could spell ‘able’ he’d
hire a poet to write Mèdor’s epitaph,” panted
Mrs. Wasson, trying to keep up with the
rest.</p>

<p>“I bought the willow for him at ‘The
Forestry,’” said Mr. Wasson, stopping beside
a small square yard enclosed by a picket
fence. And he pointed to a mound within, on
which was marked in cobble-stones the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Mèdor. A board served as headstone, and
on this in black letters was painted:—</p>

<p class="center">“MÈDOR, OUR DOG,<br>
<i>Died April 20th, 1896</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Aged 12 Years</span>.”</p>

<p>“If ever a dog deserved an epitaph that dog
did,” said Mr. Wasson seriously. “Mother
wanted me to get one up myself; but, land!
I couldn’t. I can manage bees better than I
can manage poetry.”</p>

<p>The boys retired early that night in the
tent that they shared with Captain Bradstreet.
A little later, as Molly and Pauline were
undressing in the end of the parlor tent shut
off by the Indian blankets, Molly suddenly
exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“O Polly, I’ve thought of something!
Let’s write an epitaph for Mèdor. Don’t
you believe it would please the Wassons?”</p>

<p>“Of course it would, Molly. It would tickle
them to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Comfort them, you should say, Polly.
Epitaphs don’t tickle.”</p>

<p>“That depends upon the epitaph, doesn’t
it?” asked Pauline, yawning. “How wide
open your eyes are, Molly Rowe! I’m going
to tuck you into bed this minute.”</p>

<p>Long after Pauline had floated into dream-land,
Molly lay awake beside her little sister,
listening to the voices of the night in the
leafy canyon. She recognized the hooting of
an owl; but what was that other sound, something
like a laugh and a cough and a cry all
in one? It made her flesh creep. She was
thankful when Mrs. Davidson appeared with
a lighted candle.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Davidson! what is that dreadful
noise?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“That noise, Molly? Oh, that is only the
barking of the coyotes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do you suppose they’ll get in, Mrs.
Davidson?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“In here? Why, my dear child, you couldn’t
<i>drive</i> them in. They’re the greatest cowards
in the world.”</p>

<p>“But they act so <i>mad</i>, Mrs. Davidson.”</p>

<p>“They have a sad habit of prowling around
Mr. Arnesten’s chicken-yard, Molly, but they
won’t harm us. Don’t mind their howling.
Try to go to sleep.”</p>

<small>FIVE YOUNG POETS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span>, to-day, and to-morrow were
very much alike in the canyon, and all alike
delightful to The Merry Five. The mornings
being usually cool, breakfast was served in
the dining-tent behind the parlor. After
breakfast the boys often went with Captain
Bradstreet to shoot “cotton-tail” rabbits for
dinner. Sometimes the girls followed a part
of the way in search of wild-flowers for their
herbariums.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the chocolate lilies are gone by,
Pauline?” said Molly on one of these quests.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Molly; ages ago. I don’t
think they’re very pretty, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, not pretty exactly; but they look so—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> 
sort of sensible, Pauline. They stand up
prim and plain like little Quakers.”</p>

<p>“Their clothes won’t show dirt, that’s one
good thing,” responded Pauline, scowling at
a mud-stain on her skirt. “Why is it, Molly,
that dirt never sticks to you?”</p>

<p>“O Pauline! I think it does stick to me;
but it sticks to Weezy a good deal worse. Did
you ever see such a child for getting soiled
and torn?”</p>

<p>Little Miss Weezy had remained behind at
the camp to nurse a newly hatched chicken
presented her by Mr. Arnesten.</p>

<p>“What was that, Molly, about Weezy’s
losing her stocking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we were all down on the beach, and
nothing would do but Weezy and Harry must
go in wading. I put Harry’s shoes and stockings
high and dry on the shore, and told
Weezy to put hers there too. I suppose she
gave them a toss, and they didn’t go far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
enough. Anyway, when she came out of the
water, one stocking had been washed out to sea.”</p>

<p>“How did the child get home, Molly?”</p>

<p>“How did Hi-diddle-dumpling-my-son-John
go to bed, Polly?”</p>

<p>“‘One stocking off and one stocking on,’”
quoted Pauline gayly. “And you mean to
say the poor little image had to skip away
back to The Old and New half-dressed like
that, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Yes; her gown up to her knees too!
It was that navy blue with gilt braid. It
shrunk after she fell into the ocean, and it
can’t be let down.”</p>

<p>“Were there many people around, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Many? The beach was <i>lined</i> with ‘tourers,’
as Weezy calls them; and everybody saw that
little scapegrace running by on one white leg
and one black leg. Oh, it was <i>killing</i>!”</p>

<p>“Did Weezy care?” asked Pauline, laughing
till the tears came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Yes, Polly; I’m happy to say that she
did—for about five minutes.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what her ladyship is up to now,”
said Pauline, striking into the homeward path.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose she and Olga are still
petting that sick chicken.”</p>

<p>Molly had guessed aright. She and Pauline
presently surprised the two children
playing hospital, in their favorite retreat under
a live-oak. Dressed as a nurse, with a white
kerchief pinned across her shoulders, Olga
was holding the invalid chicken tenderly in
her lap, while Weezy, also in a white kerchief,
was trying to tempt its appetite with
a preparation of Mellin’s Food.</p>

<p>“It’ll only eat the leastest bit of a mite,
Molly,” said Weezy in a hopeless voice; “and
it won’t open its little eyes.”</p>

<p>“That must be because it is weak, Nurse,”
said Molly, joining in the play. “I think it
needs a tonic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Some wine might do it good, Nurse,”
added Pauline.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; some wine. That’s what it is
crying for, maybe,” returned Weezy eagerly.
“Please give me four teaspoonfuls for him,
Pauline.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to disappoint you, Nurse,” answered
Pauline dryly; “but the fact is we
don’t keep wine on tap at this inn. Wouldn’t
pepper-tea do as well?”</p>

<p>Weezy shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Won’t pepper-tea tickle its poor little
throat, Pauline, and make it cough?”</p>

<p>“Not if the tea is well taken before shaken,
Nurse,” replied Pauline solemnly.</p>

<p>“Please put lots of sugar in, then,” said
Weezy.</p>

<p>The pepper-tea proved so fine a remedy,
that on the arrival of the boys, half an hour
later, Weezy could assure them that her patient
had begun to “take notice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>After dinner The Merry Five adjourned to
the parlor tent to finish Mèdor’s epitaph.
Each one wrote something, though Weezy’s
share was only part of a line.</p>

<p>“However, there’s enough of it, such as it
is, and it’s good enough, what there is of it,”
said Paul, repeating a worn-out joke.</p>

<p>When the four stanzas were completed,
Paul copied them neatly with his small type-writer,
and passed them to Molly to be admired.</p>

<p>“You’ve printed the epitaph beautifully,
Paul—on cardboard too. Oh, I do hope
the Wassons won’t call it doggerel!”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t doggerel, it’s <i>real doggy</i>,” put
in Kirke, and was promptly scolded for his
levity.</p>

<p>“We ought to take this out to the bee-ranch
by to-morrow, Pauline,” said Molly,
reading the composition over again after
peace had been restored. “You know Kirke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and Weezy and I must go back to Santa
Luzia Saturday.”</p>

<p>“I wish I didn’t know it, Molly.”</p>

<p>“And in two weeks more we shall all be
at home again, Pauline. I wish we could
stay away till Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“Only I wouldn’t miss of being at Silver
Gate City on Admission Day,” cried Paul,
covering his type-writer. “The streets will
be trimmed, and there’ll be arches, and bands
of music, and a procession long enough to
reach around a dozen squares and tie.”</p>

<p>“I think the street masquerade that comes
off the night before Admission Day is the
better fun,” returned Pauline. “I like dressing
up like somebody else, and wearing a mask.”</p>

<p>“But I always know you, whatever you
put on, my lady. You never can cheat me,”
replied Paul.</p>

<p>“Nor you me, Twinny dear,” retorted
Pauline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>When Pauline wished to tease her brother
she often called him “Twinny.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see if I can’t cheat you this year,
though, little sister,” rejoined Paul, with a
sly wink at Kirke.</p>

<p>For as it happened the boys had already
decided on their costumes for the masquerade,
and that very morning they had made
Auntie David promise to help in getting
these up. Mr. Davidson would be detained
some weeks longer in the East, and Mrs.
Davidson was to go to Silver Gate City with
the Bradstreets when they broke camp.</p>

<p>“It’s always nice to have Auntie David
with us,” remarked Pauline the next day as
The Merry Five were walking to the bee-ranch;
“but this fall it will be nicer than
usual, because Mrs. Cannon isn’t well enough
yet to come back to work, and Auntie
David can teach the new housekeeper.”</p>

<p>Kirke’s brown eyes twinkled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Mrs. Cannon went off, did she, Pauline?
That’s the way with cannons;—they’re always
going off.”</p>

<p>“I hope our epitaph will go off well,”
returned Pauline, as they drew near the bee-hives
where Mr. Wasson was at work.</p>

<p>“Remember, Polly, you are the one to
speak about it,” whispered Molly diffidently.
“You and Paul know the Wassons.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wasson greeted them all cordially; and
as soon as Mrs. Wasson had changed her
dress she greeted them cordially too, and
treated them to fresh buttermilk and gingerbread.
This light repast ended, Pauline
moved restlessly in her chair, uncertain how
to begin her little speech. But little Miss
Weezy presently relieved her embarrassment
by saying,—</p>

<p>“We’ve brought you some beautiful poetry,
Mr. Wasson; some we made all by ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Some poetry, little girl?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wasson arched his eyebrows till they
looked more like bows than like overturned
canoes.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s an <i>epithet</i>, Mr. Wasson. We’ve
written a lovely <i>epithet</i> for your dog.”</p>

<p>With a mirthful glance toward Molly, Pauline
hastened to explain; and as soon as
everybody was duly serious she read aloud
the stanzas. At the beginning of the second
one, Weezy could not refrain from exclaiming,
“I wrote that, I wrote, ‘he carried the
basket;’” but Pauline finished the epitaph
without further interruption.</p>

<p>“It’s elegant—just like a book,” cried
Mrs. Wasson, drying her eyes. “You were
real kind to write it.”</p>

<p>“You were <i>so</i>,” echoed Mr. Wasson with
a gratified smile at the five young poets.
“Will you see me nail it up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Mr. Wasson,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Weezy. And the children followed him to
Mèdor’s grave, and waited with Mrs. Wasson
while the cardboard was being fastened
to the wooden headstone.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of the epitaph:—</p>

<p class="center">TRIBUTE TO A DUMB FRIEND.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The noble dog Mèdor, whose death we deplore,</div>
<div class="verse">Had lived and was famous for twelve years or more;</div>

<small>MOLLY A HEROINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following Saturday The Merry Five
separated. Molly, Kirke, and Weezy went
back to Santa Luzia for a fortnight, and
then the Rowes and the Bradstreets returned
together to Silver Gate City.</p>

<p>“It seems nice to be at home again after
all, mamma,” said Molly a few mornings
after this. “I’ve missed my wheel dreadfully.
Have you any errands to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Molly. Donald needs the frocks
Mrs. Carillo has been making for him. I
wish you’d ride over to her house and get
them.”</p>

<p>“May I ask Polly to go along, mamma?”</p>

<p>“If you like. But I can’t have any ‘scorching,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
dear; and remember that you two girls
are not to race.”</p>

<p>“We won’t race, mamma. But oh! racing
is such fun! you don’t know.”</p>

<p>As Molly guided her bicycle down the
steps of the veranda, there was a shadow on
her brow. She could ride very well, even
better than Pauline. Why need her mamma
be so cautious about “scorching”?</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe must have observed the shadow;
for she followed Molly out upon the veranda,
adding tenderly,—</p>

<p>“I know this, dearie, that your papa and I
cannot afford to have you reckless. You are
our mainstay, Molly.”</p>

<p>“Your mainstay, mamma? Am I?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you are; and more than ever since
papa’s illness.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mamma.” Molly looked radiant.
“I’ll try never to be reckless any
more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>She was extremely in earnest. If anybody
had told her then that in another hour she
would be doing a frightfully daring thing she
would not have believed it. And if anybody
had told Mrs. Rowe that she herself would
not blame Molly for the disobedience, Mrs.
Rowe would not have believed that either.</p>

<p>“Can you ride up to Mrs. Carillo’s with
me, Polly?” Mrs. Rowe heard Molly call
under the window of Pauline’s room across
the way.</p>

<p>“In two seconds, Molly.” And Pauline
hastened out, trundling her safety before her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe watched the two girls spinning
down the street on their wheels till they
looked in the distance like two enormous
spiders revolving on their own webs. Then
calling Zip, who had begged to follow them,
she went into the house.</p>

<p>All the way to the little brown cottage by
the canyon, Molly and Pauline were talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
of the street masquerade now near at hand,
and discussing what they should wear.</p>

<p>“I’ve a great mind to dress in light blue,”
said Molly; “mask, gown, stockings, and all.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, Molly. You always wear blue
or lavender or something of that kind. People
would guess you in a minute. Why don’t
you wear yellow?”</p>

<p>“Yellow—with my red hair, Pauline!”</p>

<p>“Molly Rowe, your hair isn’t red, and you
know it! It is the most heavenly auburn!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, play it’s auburn. Yellow won’t
go with auburn either.”</p>

<p>Pauline knitted her black eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I have it, Molly. Pug up your tawny
mane, and cover it with a Chinese handkerchief,
or a turban. Oh, I’ll manage it.”</p>

<p>“You bright creature!”</p>

<p>“You must wear a yellow mask, Molly,
and a yellow dress with broad black stripes,
and”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“And you must blossom out in lilac, Pauline,
or the <i>babiest</i> kind of baby blue.”</p>

<p>“I might be a shepherdess, Molly, and
you could be a Spanish girl.”</p>

<p>“Only you and I are to walk together,”
mused Molly. “Do you think it seems quite
the thing for a Spanish girl to walk arm-in-arm
with a shepherdess?”</p>

<p>“Why not, you stuck-up señorita?”</p>

<p>“We might. There, Pauline, let’s do this!
Let’s you and me be the United States and
Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Or the United States and California,
Molly. Wouldn’t you rather be California?
You’d be more sort of patriotic.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’d rather be California than any
State—excepting Massachusetts,” responded
Molly loyally. “And you can be the Goddess
of Liberty trailing around in the American
flag.”</p>

<p>“That’s capital, Molly! I don’t believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the boys would ever suspect us of attempting
anything so fine.”</p>

<p>“Only we must take care not to mention
flags, or bunting, or stars or stripes, when the
boys are around.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; they’ll be on the watch for
the least hint,” said Pauline, as she and Molly
rode up to Mrs. Carillo’s cottage.</p>

<p>“You needn’t caution <i>me</i>, Molly. Hoaxing
Kirke and Paul will make half the fun of the
masquerade.”</p>

<p>“But they’re so awfully quick-witted, Polly,
I’m afraid we can’t cheat them. Have you
any notion how they will be dressed themselves?”</p>

<p>“I caught Paul with a comic mask this
morning before he had time to hide it. I
fancy Auntie David is making a clown of
him; but she won’t tell.”</p>

<p>“And your Auntie David is getting up
Kirke’s costume too. Isn’t it sweet of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Oh, she likes to do such things, Molly.”</p>

<p>“Kirke will want to be something absurd,—an
Indian boy, maybe. I saw him sneak in
at your side-door yesterday noon with toggery
rolled up in a blanket.”</p>

<p>“Did you, Molly? That accounts for the
tittering in Paul’s room about that time.”</p>

<p>“Probably the boys were having a dress-rehearsal,”
returned Molly, laughing; and her
face was still in a pucker when Manuel Carillo
opened the door.</p>

<p>“You are just starting out on your newspaper
route, aren’t you, Manuel?” she said,
observing that he had his leather bag slung
across his shoulder. “Is your mother at
home?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she’s sewing on her new machine,”
replied Manuel, laughing in his light-hearted
Spanish way.</p>

<p>In greeting the girls Mrs. Carillo laughed
too, and proudly exhibited the new sewing-machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> 
which Kirke, with his own earnings,
had helped her to purchase.</p>

<p>“You do beautiful work with it, Mrs.
Carillo,” said Molly politely. “Are Donald’s
frocks finished?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carillo replied in broken English that
the frocks were finished, and would the señorita
pardon her for neglecting to send them
home? Then, with profuse apologies, she
rolled the garments into a neat parcel, and
instructed Manuel to tie this under the seat
of Molly’s bicycle.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think Manuel has lovely manners,
Molly?” said Pauline as she and Molly
whizzed away from the cottage.</p>

<p>“Lovely, yes. Weezy says she likes Manuel
because he behaves so well.”</p>

<p>“The little witch!” Pauline rode on several
blocks without speaking, and then added,
“What will Weezy wear at the street masquerade?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The two girls were coursing side by side
along Alder Street, and were about to cross
Summit Avenue over the track of the electric
railway. Summit Avenue led down from
The Heights, and was at this point very
steep.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what she’ll wear, but she
has been teasing for two masks, and”—</p>

<p>“Mercy, Molly!” interrupted Pauline in
dismay, “see Essie Hobbs! There, there!
sitting right between the rails!”</p>

<p>“Forevermore! and the car coming!” gasped
Molly, with a horrified glance up the hill.
“Run, Essie, run!”</p>

<p>Too startled by the unexpected cry to
heed the rumbling of the motor, Essie looked
around blinking.</p>

<p>“Run, Essie; do you hear?” shouted Pauline
frantically. “Run as fast as you can!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i151">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i151.jpg" alt="‘Stop the car!’ screamed Mollie">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“‘Stop the car!’ screamed Mollie.”</p>

<p class="right"><i>Page <a href="#Page_137">137</a></i></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Essie shook her stubborn little head. The
sun in her eyes blinded her to the approaching
danger, and she did not choose to run
merely because she had been told to do so.</p>

<p>“Stop the car! stop the car!” screamed
Molly, springing from her safety, and waving
her arms wildly toward the motor-man.</p>

<p>The man began to work the brake. Till
that moment he had not observed that little
brown Essie was anything more than a patch
of dust in the road.</p>

<p>“Stop the car! Oh! why don’t you stop
the car?” shrieked Pauline, as it still plunged
on.</p>

<p>“He can’t stop it! He can’t stop it in
time!” wailed Molly, darting forward.</p>

<p>What happened next she never afterward
could recall; but somehow, in the twinkling
of an eye, she had dashed in front of the
bounding motor; she had caught dazed little
Essie about the waist, and was dragging her
off the track. Nearer and nearer down the
abrupt descent thundered the terrible car.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Molly had scarcely time to leap with her living
burden across the rail before the heavy
wheels lumbered over the very spot where
Essie had been seated.</p>

<p>“O Molly, Molly! how dared you?” shuddered
Pauline, as the car came to a stand-still
a few feet farther on. “I thought
you’d be crushed to pieces!”</p>

<p>Molly tried to reply, but seized with sudden
faintness sank down in the road with
her feet in the gutter. Pauline ran to the
nearest house for a glass of water. When
she returned with it she saw the motor-man
bending over Molly, speaking vehemently.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re the bravest girl in this
city,” he was saying in a tremulous voice.
“If it hadn’t been for you I should have
run over that baby. You’ve done me a good
turn that I sha’n’t forget in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I—I <i>had</i> to do it,” gasped Molly
through her chattering teeth. “I—I wasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
brave. I did it—just—because I couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a heroine, Molly, an out-and-out
heroine,” cried admiring Pauline, holding the
glass to Molly’s lips.</p>

<p>After the motor-man had again mounted his
platform, and the crowd gathered about the
corner had dispersed, Pauline picked up
Molly’s overturned bicycle. Donald’s frocks,
broken from their paper wrapping, lay crushed
in the mud.</p>

<p>“I’ll carry ’em ’ome for you, Molly,” said
Harry, who had come in quest of his runaway
sister; “I’ll ’old ’em in both harms.”</p>

<p>And the little English children skipped
away, serenely unconscious that Essie had
escaped a great peril.</p>

<p>But when their Aunt Ruth had heard the
adventure, she ran over to Mr. Rowe’s house
with streaming eyes to thank Molly for her
noble act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“I shall be grateful to you, Miss Molly,
while the Lord lets me draw breath,” she
cried brokenly. “You’ve snatched my little
Hessie back from the grave.”</p>

<p>“Molly risked her own life for the child’s,
Miss Hobbs,” said Mr. Rowe, stroking Molly’s
cheek.</p>

<p>His hand shook like an aspen leaf. The
recent exciting incident had unbraced his
nerves, and he was days in rallying from it.</p>

<p>“It is too bad about those frocks, mamma,”
said Molly that night before going to bed.
“The street had just been sprinkled. They’ll
all have to be washed.”</p>

<p>“What of that, Molly? Soiled frocks seem
of very little consequence to me to-night.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Rowe spoke she knelt beside
Molly’s bed, and gave her a fond kiss.</p>

<p>“Only the clothes were new, mamma.”</p>

<p>“Who cares for new clothes compared to
human lives, my Molly?” Mrs. Rowe’s voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
was unsteady. “I thank the good Father on
my knees for letting you save Essie, and for
sparing our dear daughter to her father and
me.”</p>

<p>And she kissed Molly again and again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE STREET MASQUERADE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the evening before Admission Day.
Silver Gate City wore its gala dress in honor
of the approaching 9th of September, the
anniversary of the birth of the State of California.</p>

<p>Arches draped with flags spanned the street
corners; streamers of red, orange, and green
floated from trolley and telegraph wires; palm-branches
and festoons of bunting decked the
fronts of houses and shops. To-morrow the
city was to be serious and grand with orations
and bands of music, but to-night it was on
tiptoe for a frolic.</p>

<p>Directly after tea Molly and Pauline retired
to Molly’s room to prepare for the street masquerade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Kirke and Paul were arraying themselves
in Paul’s room across the way, roaring
and clapping at intervals with such gusto that
Captain Bradstreet, in the library beneath,
chuckled from sympathy.</p>

<p>The captain was to pose at the festival as
General Washington, and had already donned
a long military coat, black stockings, and
knee-breeches of velvet.</p>

<p>“Unless our ears deceive us, Patsy, those
young people are in pretty fair spirits,” he
said, with a courtly bow to Mrs. Davidson,
who stood at his elbow dressed like Martha
Washington.</p>

<p>She wore an old-fashioned brocade gown,
with her powdered hair rolled back from her
forehead over a cushion.</p>

<p>“The same thought has occurred to myself,
General,” she replied archly, as she arranged
the white ruffles at his wrists. “They
are bent on mystifying their sisters to-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and are highly pleased with the costumes
selected.”</p>

<p>“That is evident, madam. Are you the
only one in the secret?”</p>

<p>“The only one besides Mrs. Rowe. The
boys want to mingle in the crowd before giving
you an opportunity to recognize them.
Shall we go on?”</p>

<p>The false father of his country bowed assent,
and reached for his three-cornered hat.</p>

<p>“Since it is your will, madam, we will depart
forthwith.”</p>

<p>The Revolutionary pair had secured reserved
seats in a sun parlor overlooking the plaza,
and Mr. and Mrs. Rowe occupied chairs near
them. Mrs. Rowe wore a black silk dress,
and had thrown over her head a lace mantilla.
Mr. Rowe sported a Spanish hat and cloak.</p>

<p>“Papa plays he’s a Spanish man, Auntie
David, so he won’t get cold,” explained pink-robed
Weezy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Little Miss Weezy had known Mrs. Davidson
and Captain Bradstreet at first sight, because
Pauline had described the garments in
which they would appear.</p>

<p>“Your papa is a very sensible man, little
queen of the fairies,” returned the make-believe
Lady Washington; and she stooped
to bend in shape the wire taste in Weezy’s
drooping left wing.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to see if I can tell Kirke
and Mollie in their play clothes,” said her
dainty majesty, with a touch of her wand on
General Washington’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The general smiled upon her as she flitted
away like a roseate cloud.</p>

<p>Through her pink silk mask, she observed
many wonders in the street outside, and presently,
she danced back to her mother, crying,—</p>

<p>“Look, look, mamma! There are Pauline
and Mollie! White dresses on; sunbonnets
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>The masked faces beneath the white sunbonnets
turned in the direction of Weezy’s
voice, but the white figures moved forward
without halting.</p>

<p>“They’re just <i>a-funning</i>, mamma. It <i>was</i>
Pauline and Molly, now truly.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that the taller one is
too tall for my Pauline, and the shorter one
is too short for your Molly, señora,” said
General George Washington Bradstreet, following
with his eye the simply arrayed couple.</p>

<p>Turning neither to the right nor to the
left, they walked on, arm-in-arm, under the
brilliant arc light, while the fairy queen’s
mamma smiled behind her black mask. Of
all in the sun parlor, she and Lady Washington
alone knew how Pauline and Molly were
to be dressed.</p>

<p>Weezy grew impatient.</p>

<p>“Say, mamma, please. Wasn’t it Pauline
and Molly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“I mustn’t tell you, little queeny.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I hate that ugly thing over
your face, mamma. You don’t look like my
pretty mamma. You look like some other
little girl’s mamma.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” Mrs. Rowe laughed. “And you
look to me, fairy queen, like some other
mamma’s little girl.”</p>

<p>“I hope Kirke won’t guess I’m his onty
donty sister, mamma. Where is Kirke, I’d
like to know.”</p>

<p>The longer Weezy watched the comers and
goers, the more bewildered she grew. Here
stalked a tall man in a white sheet, his face
muffled in a pillow-case; and next him Weezy
spied a yellow pumpkin marching on two
feet. At least it appeared to be a pumpkin,
only Weezy had never before beheld any pumpkin
that had a boy’s head in place of a stem.</p>

<p>“O mamma, see! There’s a little girl looks
just like a tulip! And there’s a little boy—O<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> 
mamma, mamma, <i>do</i> see him! He’s all
black and part yellow like a big <i>sting-y</i> bumblebee!”</p>

<p>Weezy hopped up and down too excited to
keep still.</p>

<p>“I expect any minute to see her fly into
the air on those gauze wings of hers,” remarked
General Washington. And of course
he meant what he said, for George Washington
never told a lie.</p>

<p>“Don’t be uneasy about her, General,” responded
the pretended Spanish lady playfully.
“She won’t flutter far from the earth while
these strange sights are to be witnessed.”</p>

<p>To and fro past the sun parlor trooped
monks with cowls, and nuns with rosaries;
men dressed in gunny-sacks, and women
dressed in newspapers. All wore masks.
Weezy saw pretty masks and hideous masks;
masks of pigs’ faces, of pug-dogs’ faces, of
negro, Chinese, and tattooed Indian faces. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
every direction the square was a moving mass
of varied color. To look through the window
was like looking through a slowly whirling
kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>“Now those white girls are coming back,
mamma,” called Weezy. “And here’s an old,
old woman with a queer hat on, and she’s
got a dog.”</p>

<p>“That woman must be Old Mother Hubbard,
Weezy.”</p>

<p>“And, O mamma! can you see? There’s
somebody with a striped dress on. It’s red
and white; blue too. It looks like Fourth
of July.”</p>

<p>Her mamma preserved a discreet silence.</p>

<p>“And, oh, please, mamma, see that other
somebody with her! Her clothes are all red
and orange and green.”</p>

<p>The “somebodies” were Pauline and Molly,
and they were laughing under their breath to
hear Weezy talk about them in this high key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“They’ll never guess me in this black
wig, Pauline,” whispered Molly, taking long
steps to disguise her gait.</p>

<p>“Nor me in this blond one, unless Paul
does,” returned Pauline. “Isn’t it strange
that we haven’t found him and Kirke yet?”</p>

<p>“Very. I’ve taken particular notice of all
the clowns and Indians, Miss Stars-and-Stripes.
They don’t any of them seem like our boys.”</p>

<p>“I’m wondering, Miss Gold-State, if Paul
didn’t give me a glimpse of that comic mask
on purpose to fool me.”</p>

<p>Here Old Mother Hubbard turned aside to
join Mother Goose, and this brought United-States
Pauline and California Molly next the
two “white girls.”</p>

<p>“It would be just like him, Miss Stars-and-Stripes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any fun in dressing up in
sunbonnets,” remarked Pauline of her neighbors
in front. “It’s no disguise at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“No,” returned Molly. “We can wear sunbonnets
any day.”</p>

<p>The white maskers quickened their pace.</p>

<p>“Hush, Molly! I’m afraid those girls have
overheard every word we’ve said,” said Pauline,
pulling down her blue liberty cap. “See
them shake. They’re laughing at us.”</p>

<p>“If they’re laughing we haven’t hurt their
feelings, Pauline, so I don’t care.”</p>

<p>Had not Molly’s ears been partially covered
by her wig she might have heard a
faint titter from under the nearest sunbonnet.</p>

<p>“I think those must be country girls,
Molly; don’t you? They kick out the hems
of their gowns every step they take.”</p>

<p>“You ought to give them lessons in Delsarte,
Pauline.”</p>

<p>Molly and Pauline had again come around
to the enclosed balcony, where Weezy stood
at an open window gazing out.</p>

<p>“The little fairy queen hasn’t the least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
idea who we are,” whispered Pauline triumphantly;
“nobody has but your mother.
Take longer steps, Miss California, or your
papa will know you by the way you walk.”</p>

<p>“And your papa’ll know you, Miss Liberty
Cap, by the way you swing your arms.”</p>

<p>“No, he shan’t. I’ll hold them as stiff as
Indian clubs.”</p>

<p>“That’s a dear; and I’ll march like a colonel.
You needn’t be afraid of my giving
us away, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Unless you spoil everything by giggling,
Miss California. You’re <i>such</i> a girl to giggle!”</p>

<p>Pauline was giggling herself, but so softly
that no one in the sun parlor was the wiser;
no, not even Lady Washington, who sat only
a few feet from the pavement.</p>

<p>“What makes them press back upon us so?”
said Molly, suddenly stopped by the crowd in
front. “Stretch your neck, Miss Stars-and-Stripes.”</p>

<p>Pauline had the advantage of Molly in being
the taller.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, Mother Goose has lost her goose!
No—yes—no—she’s caught it! What a
scramble! Why, Molly, Mother Goose must
be a boy! Who knows but it’s Paul?”</p>

<p>“Or Kirke, Pauline!”</p>

<p>People began to move on again. When
the crush was over, the girls found themselves
once more beside the white sunbonnets. The
wearers of the bonnets bowed in a friendly
fashion, and one of them—it was the shorter—handed
Pauline a bunch of carnations.</p>

<p>Pauline murmured her thanks, and whispered
to Molly that she thought she had met
that girl before—perhaps at La Jolla.</p>

<p>How much longer the pleasant farce might
have gone on but for Zip cannot be told, for
at this point that inquisitive little dog appeared
upon the scene to find out what Molly and
Kirke were doing. Barking and whining, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
frisked about Molly, “saluting the flag” as
Pauline said; and after that performance of
what use was it for Molly to pretend that
she was <i>not</i> Molly?</p>

<p>And as if he had not already done mischief
enough, Zip next charged at the girl who
had given Pauline the pinks, and the girl’s
mask dropped down, and everybody saw that
the supposed maiden was Kirke Rowe.</p>

<p>Weezy almost laughed her wings off at the
sight, while General Washington and the
“Spanish man” openly applauded.</p>

<p>“To think,” said the amused general, “that
those children should have kept their secret
the whole evening, and that after all it should
have been the dog that let the cat out of the
bag!”</p>

<p>But the cat was out, and thus ended the
farce for our masqueraders.</p>

<p>The evening had been a delight, and we will
leave the happy children laughing and complimenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
one another on the extraordinary
shrewdness they had displayed in disguising
themselves. We may meet them again in a
year and a day; who knows where? Possibly
in the City of the Silver Gate, possibly in
Europe. But wherever it may be, The Merry
Five will not appear again with masks on
their faces.</p>

<p class="ph3">PENN SHIRLEY’S<br>
STORIES</p>

<p class="ph1">FOR THE LITTLE ONES</p>

<p>Miss Penn Shirley is a very graceful interpreter of child-life.
She thoroughly understands how to reach out to the tender chord
of the little one’s feelings, and to interest her in the noble life of
her young companions. Her stories are full of bright lessons
but they do not take on the character of moralizing sermons.
Her keen observation and ready sympathy teach her how to deal
with the little ones in helping them to understand the lessons of
life. Her stories are simple and unaffected.—<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p class="ph3">THE LITTLE MISS WEEZY SERIES</p>

<p class="center">Three volumes Illustrated Boxed, each 75 cents</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="ph1">LITTLE MISS WEEZY</p>

<p>One of the freshest and most delightful, because the most
natural of the stories of the year for children, is “Little Miss
Weezy,” by Penn Shirley. It relates the oddities, the mischief,
the adventures, and the misadventures of a tiny two-year-old
maiden, full of life and spirit, and capable of the most unexpected
freaks and pranks. The book is full of humor, and is
written with a delicate sympathy with the feelings of children,
which will make it pleasing to children and parents alike.
Really good child literature is not over-plenty, despite the multitude
of books that come daily from the press; and it is pleasing
to welcome a new author whose first volume, like this one of
Penn Shirley, adds promise of future good work to actual present
merit.—<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>
<hr class="tiny">

<p class="ph1">LITTLE MISS WEEZY’S BROTHER</p>

<p>This is a good story for young children, bringing in the same
characters as “Little Miss Weezy” of last year, and continuing
the history of a very natural and wide-awake family of children.
The doings and the various “scrapes” of Kirke, the brother,
form a prominent feature of the book, and are such as we may
see any day in the school or home life of a well-cared-for and
good-intentioned little boy. There are several quite pleasing
full-page illustrations.—<i>The Dial.</i></p>

<p>We should like to see the person who thinks it “easy enough
to write for children,” attempt a book like the “Miss Weezy”
stories. Excepting Sophie May’s childish classics, we don’t know
of anything published as bright as the sayings and doings of the
little Louise and her friends. Their pranks and capers are no
more like Dotty Dimple’s than those of one bright child are like
another’s, but they are just as “cute” as those of the little folks
that play in your yard or around your neighbor’s doorsteps.—<i>Journal
of Education.</i></p>
<hr class="tiny">

<p class="ph1">LITTLE MISS WEEZY’S SISTER</p>

<p>“It is one of the best of the series, and will please every child
who reads it. It is brought out just at the holiday time, and is
brimful of good things. Every character in it is true to nature
and the doings of a bright lot of children, in which Miss Mary
Rowe figures conspicuously, will entertain grown folks as well
as little ones.”</p>

<p>It is a thoroughly clever and delightful story of child-life,
gracefully told, and charming in its blending of humor and
pathos. The children in the book are real children, and the
pretty plot through which they move is fully in harmony with
the characters. The young ones will find it a storehouse of pleasant
things pleasantly related, and a book that will appeal at once
to their sentiments and sympathies.—<i>Boston Gazette.</i></p>

<p>A book that will hold the place of honor on the nursery bookshelf,
until it falls to pieces from much handling, is “Little Miss
Weezy’s Sister,” a simple, yet absorbing story of children who
are interesting because they are so real. It is doing scant justice
to say for the author, Penn Shirley, that the annals of child-life
have seldom been traced with more loving care.—<i>Boston Times.</i></p>
